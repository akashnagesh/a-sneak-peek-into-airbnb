The room was nice, all place was clean. Islam managed pretty well our arrival, even if it was last minute ;) i do recommand this place to any airbnb user :)"1178162	4869189	41423	6452964	Charlotte	Great location for both airport and city - great amenities in the house: Plus Islam was always very helpful even though he was away1178162	5003196	41431	6449554	Sebastian	We really enjoyed our stay at Islams house. From the outside the house didn't look so inviting but the inside was very nice! Even though Islam himself was not there everything was prepared for our arrival. The airport T Station is only a 5-10 min walk away. The only little issue was that all the people in the house had to share one bathroom. But it was not really a problem and it worked out fine. We would recommend Islams place for a stay in Boston. 1178162	5150351	41440	2215611	Marine	The room was nice and clean and so were the commodities. Very close to the airport metro station and located in quite safe area. Islam responds very quickly and is very helpful. I would recommend it. 1178162	5171140	41441	6848427	Andrew	"Great location.

Really nice and helpful hosts - taking there time to explain all the good things to see and how to come there.We had a really nice time in Boston and they had a big part on that.If you want to go out doing sth - just ask them and they may come with you.Really nice and clean house - near to the airport and the subway station ( like 6 minutes away ). We had a really good time there and can just recommend it to anyone who want to have a comfortable and enjoyable place to stay in Boston for a good price. Thanks a lot.1178162	6873023	41514	7671888	Elodie	"Islam is a very nice guy ! Attentive, funny, he gave me recommandation and info about boston ( nightlife, places to go and so on) His flat is clean, tidy and there is a patio which is a real plus! I DO recommand this, great experience !"1178162	7646702	41545	8197342	Arkadiusz	"The place is really well furnished, pleasant and clean. Islam was very helpful, you can feel free to ask him virtually anything and he'll help you. He was fun too, very cool talking to him. Oh, and the place is pretty conveniently located too. Highly recommended.The neighbourhood might not be the cleanest in Boston (my gf liked Brooklyne much more in that matter), but this is a great location and price for value overall."1178162	8094418	41562	9040491	Matthew	Our stay at Islam's place was fantastic. We couldn't have asked for a better value on location and amenities. We felt very much at home and comfortable at his place and would be quick to stay with him again if we return to Boston!Islam was always quick to respond to any questions or concerns we had and very accommodating at every point in our trip! Truly a wonderful place and a lovely host!1178162	8174594	41566	9101576	Simona	"Our stay at Islam's was very enjoyable, Islam is a very kind and responsive host.The room was clean and comfortable and the house is provided with all comforts: full kitchen, satellite TV, comfortable living room, excellent WIFI connection in all areas.It is extremely conveniently located to downtown Boston (a few metro stops) and walking distance to the free shuttles connecting to the airport. "1178162	8226316	41568	884407	Laurent	"Communication with Islam and his brother was good. However, we arrived at their house and the toilet was completely plugged up and full of excrements. At this point, we were totally disgusted. We went out to town, which by train takes about 15mn plus 10mn walk to the station. We managed to speak with Islam brother. He fixed the problem when we came back by 4pm. The house is basic with thin walls and the bedrooms are minimum comfort. We were supposed to be on the basement, which I really don't recommend. Bad smell and the bed is for one person rather than two. We stayed in the upper room, as we though we were there. Nobody in the house except from one guest staying also in the upper level. Islam sent us an email during our stay, which we couldn't see as we didn't have a computer with us or the use of our smartphone. However, he told us to stay in the basement while no booking was made for the upper room. Not sure why he wanted us to stay in the basement where the room and bed were very basic, when he could have told us to stay in the room upstairs!The fact that the owner wasn't there made it a strange feeling. The back door in the kitchen were not locked at all, while our luggage was in the house. We didn't got told at all. We had to put a bar across to kinda off close the sliding door but felt very unsafe as anybody could have walking in easily or made their way in.All in all, things went fine by the end but we definitely not recommend the place unless the owner is there. If you are looking for a cheap place to stay and don't mind of those inconvenience, then you will like it.A part from that Boston is a great city and we had fun!"1178162	8372308	41575	8837991	Olga Maria	"Mi estad�_a en Boston aunque corta fue muy buena, la habitaci�_n excelente, muy limpia y ordenada, no tuve ning̼n inconveniente dentro de la casa. Si vuelvo a Boston volver̩ a buscarlos. Gracias!! "1178162	8414572	41576	478275	Kat	"Well sized room for two people with the basic necessities which also included a mini fridge. Our room, the common areas and bathrooms were clean when we arrived. There were good kitchen facilities but we did not have to use them. Overall good value for a location that is close enough to downtown Boston. "1178162	8523707	41582	8824032	Ivan	"GREAT SPACE, PERFECT LOCATION, AWESOME PEOPLE!! Definately will be back!!!! "
