A	1
very,	1
very,	1
very	1
slow-moving,	1
aimless	1
movie	1
about	1
a	1
distressed,	1
drifting	1
young	1
man.	1
0	1
Not	1
sure	1
who	1
was	1
more	1
lost	1
-	1
the	1
flat	1
characters	1
or	1
the	1
audience,	1
nearly	1
half	1
of	1
whom	1
walked	1
out.	1
0	1
Attempting	1
artiness	1
with	1
black	1
&	1
white	1
and	1
clever	1
camera	1
angles,	1
the	1
movie	1
disappointed	1
-	1
became	1
even	1
more	1
ridiculous	1
-	1
as	1
the	1
acting	1
was	1
poor	1
and	1
the	1
plot	1
and	1
lines	1
almost	1
non-existent.	1
0	1
Very	1
little	1
music	1
or	1
anything	1

The	1
best	1
scene	1
in	1
the	1
movie	1
was	1
when	1
Gerardo	1
is	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
song	1
that	1
keeps	1
running	1
through	1
his	1
head.	1
1	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
movie	1
lacks	1
art,	1
charm,	1
meaning...	1
If	1
it's	1
about	1
emptiness,	1
it	1
works	1
I	1
guess	1
because	1
it's	1
empty.	1
0	1
Wasted	1
two	1
hours.	1
0	1
Saw	1
the	1
movie	1
today	1
and	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
effort,	1
good	1
messages	1
for	1
kids.	1
1	1
A	1
bit	1
predictable.	1
0	1
Loved	1
the	1
casting	1
of	1
Jimmy	1
Buffet	1
as	1
the	1
science	1
teacher.	1
1	1
And	1
those	1
baby	1
owls	1
were	1
adorable.	1
1	1
The	1
movie	1
showed	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
Florida	1
at	1
it's	1
best,	1
made	1
it	1
look	1
very	1
appealing.	1
1	1
The	1
Songs	1
Were	1
The	1
Best	1
And	1
The	1
Muppets	1
Were	1
So	1
Hilarious.	1
1	1
It	1
Was	1
So	1
Cool.	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
"right	1
on	1
case"	1
movie	1
that	1
delivers	1
everything	1
almost	1
right	1
in	1
your	1
face.	1
1	1
It	1
had	1
some	1
average	1
acting	1
from	1
the	1
main	1
person,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
low	1
budget	1
as	1
you	1
clearly	1
can	1
see.	1

This	1
review	1
is	1
long	1
overdue,	1
since	1
I	1
consider	1
A	1
Tale	1
of	1
Two	1
Sisters	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
single	1
greatest	1
film	1
ever	1
made.	1
1	1
I'll	1
put	1
this	1
gem	1
up	1
against	1
any	1
movie	1
in	1
terms	1
of	1
screenplay,	1
cinematography,	1
acting,	1
post-production,	1
editing,	1
directing,	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
aspect	1
of	1
film-making.	1
1	1
It's	1
practically	1
perfect	1
in	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
	1
a	1
true	1
masterpiece	1
in	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
faux	1
"masterpieces.	1
1	1
"	1
The	1
structure	1
of	1
this	1
film	1
is	1
easily	1
the	1
most	1
tightly	1
constructed	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
cinema.	1
1	1
I	1
can	1
think	1
of	1
no	1
other	1
film	1
where	1
something	1
vitally	1
important	1
occurs	1
every	1
other	1
minute.	1
1	1
In	1
other	1
words,	1
the	1
content	1
level	1
of	1
this	1
film	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
easily	1
fill	1
a	1
dozen	1
other	1
films.	1
1	1
How	1
can	1
anyone	1
in	1
their	1
right	1
mind	1
ask	1
for	1
anything	1
more	1
from	1
a	1
movie	1
than	1
this?	1
1	1
It's	1
quite	1
simply	1
the	1
highest,	1
most	1
superlative	1
form	1
of	1
cinema	1
imaginable.	1
1	1
Yes,	1
this	1
film	1
does	1
require	1
a	1
rather	1
significant	1
amount	1
of	1
puzzle-solving,	1
but	1
the	1
pieces	1
fit	1
together	1
to	1
create	1
a	1
beautiful	1
picture.	1
1	1
This	1
short	1
film	1
certainly	1
pulls	1
no	1
punches.	1

Graphics	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
best	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
game.	1
0	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
number	1
one	1
best	1
TH	1
game	1
in	1
the	1
series.	1
1	1
It	1
deserves	1
strong	1
love.	1
1	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
insane	1
game.	1
1	1
There	1
are	1
massive	1
levels,	1
massive	1
unlockable	1
characters...	1
it's	1
just	1
a	1
massive	1
game.	1
1	1
Waste	1
your	1
money	1
on	1
this	1
game.	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
money	1
that	1
is	1
wasted	1
properly.	1
1	1
Actually,	1
the	1
graphics	1
were	1
good	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
1	1
Today	1
the	1
graphics	1
are	1
crap.	1
0	1
As	1
they	1
say	1
in	1
Canada,	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
fun	1
game,	1
aye.	1
1	1
This	1
game	1
rocks.	1
1	1
Buy	1
it,	1
play	1
it,	1
enjoy	1
it,	1
love	1
it.	1
1	1
It's	1
PURE	1
BRILLIANCE.	1
1	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
flick	1
doomed	1
from	1
its	1
conception.	1
0	1
The	1
very	1
idea	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
lame	1
-	1
take	1
a	1
minor	1
character	1
from	1
a	1
mediocre	1
PG-13	1
film,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
complete	1
non-sequel	1
while	1
changing	1
its	1
tone	1
to	1
a	1
PG-rated	1
family	1
movie.	1
0	1
I	1
wasn't	1
the	1
least	1
bit	1
interested.	1
0	1
Not	1
only	1
did	1
it	1
only	1
confirm	1
that	1
the	1
film	1
would	1
be	1
unfunny	1
and	1
generic,	1
but	1
it	1
also	1
managed	1
to	1
give	1
away	1
the	1
ENTIRE	1
movie;	1
and	1
I'm	1
not	1
exaggerating	1
-	1
every	1
moment,	1
every	1
plot	1
point,	1
every	1
joke	1
is	1
told	1
in	1
the	1
trailer.	1
0	1
But	1
it's	1
just	1
not	1
funny.	1
0	1
But	1
even	1
the	1
talented	1
Carrell	1
can't	1
save	1
this.	1
0	1
His	1
co-stars	1
don't	1
fare	1
much	1
better,	1
with	1
people	1
like	1
Morgan	1
Freeman,	1
Jonah	1
Hill,	1
and	1
Ed	1
Helms	1
just	1
wasted.	1
0	1
The	1
story	1
itself	1
is	1
just	1
predictable	1
and	1
lazy.	1
0	1
The	1
only	1
real	1
effects	1
work	1
is	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
animals,	1
and	1
the	1
integration	1
of	1
those	1
into	1
the	1
scenes	1
is	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
worst	1
and	1
most	1
obvious	1
blue/green-screen	1
work	1
I've	1
ever	1
seen.	1
0	1
But	1
whatever	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
cost	1
them	1
so	1
much,	1
it	1
didn't	1
translate	1
to	1
quality,	1
that's	1
for	1
sure.	1
0	1
The	1
film	1
succeeds	1
despite,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
because	1
of,	1
an	1
obviously	1
meagre	1
budget.	1
1	1
I'm	1
glad	1
the	1
film	1
didn't	1
go	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
obvious	1
choice,	1
as	1
a	1
lesser	1
film	1
certainly	1
would	1
have.	1
1	1
In	1
addition	1
to	1
having	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
lovely	1
songs	1
ever	1
written,	1
French	1
Cancan	1
also	1
boasts	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cutest	1
leading	1
ladies	1
ever	1
to	1
grace	1
the	1
screen.	1
1	1
It's	1
hard	1
not	1
to	1
fall	1
head-over-heels	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
that	1
girl.	1
1	1
On	1
the	1
negative,	1
it's	1
insipid	1
enough	1
to	1
cause	1
regret	1
for	1
another	1
2	1
hours	1
of	1
life	1
wasted	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
screen.	1
0	1
Long,	1
whiny	1
and	1
pointless.	1
0	1
But	1
I	1
recommend	1
waiting	1
for	1
their	1
future	1
efforts,	1
let	1
this	1
one	1
go.	1
0	1
Excellent	1
cast,	1
story	1
line,	1
performances.	1
1	1
Totally	1
believable.	1
1	1
Anne	1
Heche	1
was	1
utterly	1
convincing.	1
1	1
Sam	1
Shepard's	1
portrayal	1
of	1
a	1
gung	1
ho	1
Marine	1
was	1
sobering.	1
1	1
I	1
sat	1
riveted	1
to	1
the	1
TV	1
screen.	1
1	1
All	1
in	1
all	1
I	1
give	1
this	1
one	1
a	1
resounding	1
9	1
out	1
of	1
10.	1
1	1
I	1
do	1
think	1
Tom	1
Hanks	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
actor.	1
1	1
I	1
enjoyed	1
reading	1
this	1
book	1
to	1
my	1
children	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
little.	1
1	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
disappointed	1
in	1
the	1
movie.	1
0	1
One	1
character	1
is	1
totally	1
annoying	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
gives	1
me	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
fingernails	1
on	1
a	1
chalkboard.	1
0	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
totally	1
unnecessary	1
train/roller	1
coaster	1
scene.	1
0	1
There	1
was	1
absolutely	1
no	1
warmth	1
or	1
charm	1
to	1
these	1
scenes	1
or	1
characters.	1
0	1
This	1
movie	1
totally	1
grates	1
on	1
my	1
nerves.	1
0	1
The	1
performances	1
are	1
not	1
improved	1
by	1
improvisation,	1
because	1
the	1
actors	1
now	1
have	1
twice	1
as	1
much	1
to	1
worry	1
about:	1
not	1
only	1
whether	1
they're	1
delivering	1
the	1
line	1
well,	1
but	1
whether	1
the	1
line	1
itself	1
is	1
any	1
good.	1
0	1
And,	1
quite	1
honestly,	1
often	1
its	1
not	1
very	1
good.	1
0	1
Often	1
the	1
dialogue	1
doesn't	1
really	1
follow	1
from	1
one	1
line	1
to	1
another,	1
or	1
fit	1
the	1
surroundings.	1
0	1
It	1
crackles	1
with	1
an	1
unpredictable,	1
youthful	1
energy	1
-	1
but	1
honestly,	1
i	1
found	1
it	1
hard	1
to	1
follow	1
and	1
concentrate	1
on	1
it	1
meanders	1
so	1
badly.	1
0	1
There	1
are	1
some	1
generally	1
great	1
things	1
in	1
it.	1
1	1
I	1
wouldn't	1
say	1
they're	1
worth	1
2	1
hours	1
of	1
your	1
time,	1
though.	1
0	1
The	1
suspense	1
builders	1
were	1
good,	1
&	1
just	1
cross	1
the	1
line	1
from	1
G	1
to	1
PG.	1
1	1
I	1
especially	1
liked	1
the	1
non-cliche	1
choices	1
with	1
the	1
parents;	1
in	1
other	1
movies,	1
I	1
could	1
predict	1
the	1
dialog	1
verbatim,	1
but	1
the	1
writing	1
in	1
this	1
movie	1
made	1
better	1
selections.	1
1	1
If	1
you	1
want	1
a	1
movie	1
that's	1
not	1
gross	1
but	1
gives	1
you	1
some	1
chills,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
choice.	1
1	1
Alexander	1
Nevsky	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
film.	1
1	1
He	1
is	1
an	1
amazing	1
film	1
artist,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
whoever	1
lived.	1
1	1
I'm	1
glad	1
this	1
pretentious	1
piece	1
of	1
s***	1
didn't	1
do	1
as	1
planned	1
by	1
the	1
Dodge	1
stratus	1
Big	1
Shots...	1
It's	1
gonna	1
help	1
movie	1
makers	1
who	1
aren't	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
restrained	1
"movie	1
business"	1
of	1
Québec.	1
0	1
This	1
if	1
the	1
first	1
movie	1
I've	1
given	1
a	1
10	1
to	1
in	1
years.	1
1	1
If	1
there	1
was	1
ever	1
a	1
movie	1
that	1
needed	1
word-of-mouth	1
to	1
promote,	1
this	1
is	1
it.	1
1	1
Overall,	1
the	1
film	1
is	1
interesting	1
and	1
thought-provoking.	1
1	1
Plus,	1
it	1
was	1
well-paced	1
and	1
suited	1
its	1
relatively	1
short	1
run	1
time.	1
1	1
Give	1
this	1
one	1
a	1
look.	1
1	1
I	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
10	1
1	1
The	1
Wind	1
and	1
the	1
Lion	1
is	1
well	1
written	1
and	1
superbly	1
acted.	1
1	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
true	1
classic.	1
1	1
It	1
actually	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
pretty	1
decent	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
B-list	1
horror/suspense	1
films	1
go.	1
1	1
Definitely	1
worth	1
checking	1
out.	1
1	1
The	1
problem	1
was	1
the	1
script.	1
0	1
It	1
was	1
horrendous.	1
0	1
There	1
was	1
NOTHING	1
believable	1
about	1
it	1
at	1
all.	1
0	1
The	1
only	1
suspense	1
I	1
was	1
feeling	1
was	1
the	1
frustration	1
at	1
just	1
how	1
retarded	1
the	1
girls	1
were.	1
0	1
MANNA	1
FROM	1
HEAVEN	1
is	1
a	1
terrific	1
film	1
that	1
is	1
both	1
predictable	1
and	1
unpredictable	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
1	1
The	1
scenes	1
are	1
often	1
funny	1
and	1
occasionally	1
touching	1
as	1
the	1
characters	1
evaluate	1
their	1
lives	1
and	1
where	1
they	1
are	1
going.	1
1	1
The	1
cast	1
of	1
veteran	1
actors	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
just	1
a	1
nostalgia	1
trip.	1
1	1
Ursula	1
Burton's	1
portrayal	1
of	1
the	1
nun	1
is	1
both	1
touching	1
and	1
funny	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
with	1
out	1
making	1
fun	1
of	1
nuns	1
or	1
the	1
church.	1
1	1
If	1
you	1
are	1
looking	1
for	1
a	1
movie	1
with	1
a	1
terrific	1
cast,	1
some	1
good	1
music(including	1
a	1
Shirley	1
Jones	1
rendition	1
of	1
"The	1
Way	1
You	1
Look	1
Tonight"),	1
and	1
an	1
uplifting	1
ending,	1
give	1
this	1
one	1
a	1
try.	1
1	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
disappointed.	1
1	1
Frankly,	1
after	1
Cotton	1
club	1
and	1
Unfaithful,	1
it	1
was	1
kind	1
of	1
embarrassing	1
to	1
watch	1
Lane	1
and	1
Gere	1
in	1
this	1
film,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
BAD.	1
0	1
The	1
acting	1
was	1
bad,	1
the	1
dialogs	1
were	1
extremely	1
shallow	1
and	1
insincere.	1
0	1
It	1
was	1
too	1
predictable,	1
even	1
for	1
a	1
chick	1
flick.	1
0	1
Too	1
politically	1
correct.	1
0	1
Very	1
disappointing.	1
0	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
really	1
worth	1
watching	1
was	1
the	1
scenery	1
and	1
the	1
house,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
beautiful.	1
1	1
I	1
love	1
Lane,	1
but	1
I've	1
never	1
seen	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
movie	1
this	1
lousy.	1
0	1
An	1
hour	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
bring	1
back.	1
0	1
But	1
in	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
writing	1
it's	1
very	1
fresh	1
and	1
bold.	1
1	1
The	1
acting	1
helps	1
the	1
writing	1
along	1
very	1
well	1
(maybe	1
the	1
idiot-savant	1
sister	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
played	1
better),	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
real	1
joy	1
to	1
watch.	1
1	1
The	1
directing	1
and	1
the	1
cinematography	1
aren't	1
quite	1
as	1
good.	1
0	1
The	1
movie	1
was	1
so	1
boring,	1
that	1
I	1
sometimes	1
found	1
myself	1
occupied	1
peaking	1
in	1
the	1
paper	1
instead	1
of	1
watching	1
(never	1
happened	1
during	1
a	1
Columbo	1
movie	1
before!	1
0	1
),	1
and	1
sometimes	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
embarrassing	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
look	1
away.	1
0	1
The	1
directing	1
seems	1
too	1
pretentious.	1
0	1
The	1
scenes	1
with	1
the	1
"oh-so-mature"	1
neighbour-girl	1
are	1
a	1
misplace.	1
0	1
And	1
generally	1
the	1
lines	1
and	1
plot	1
is	1
weaker	1
than	1
the	1
average	1
episode.	1
0	1
Then	1
scene	1
where	1
they	1
debated	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
sack	1
the	1
trumpeter	1
(who	1
falsely	1
was	1
accused	1
for	1
the	1
murder)	1
is	1
pure	1
horror,	1
really	1
stupid.	1
0	1
Some	1
applause	1
should	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
"prelude"	1
however.	1
1	1
I	1
really	1
liked	1
that.	1
1	1
A	1
great	1
film	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
director.	1
1	1
The	1
movie	1
had	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
your	1
seat	1
and	1
made	1
you	1
somewhat	1
afraid	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
your	1
car	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1
1	1
The	1
music	1
in	1
the	1
film	1
is	1
really	1
nice	1
too.	1
1	1
I'd	1
advise	1
anyone	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
it.	1
1	1
Brilliant!	1
1	1
10/10	1
1	1
I	1
liked	1
this	1
movie	1
way	1
too	1
much.	1
1	1
My	1
only	1
problem	1
is	1
I	1
thought	1
the	1
actor	1
playing	1
the	1
villain	1
was	1
a	1
low	1
rent	1
Michael	1
Ironside.	1
0	1
It	1
rocked	1
my	1
world	1
and	1
is	1
certainly	1
a	1
must	1
see	1
for	1
anyone	1
with	1
no	1
social	1
or	1
physical	1
outlets.	1
1	1
However,	1
this	1
didn't	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
overall,	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
tremendously	1
boring	1
movie.	1
0	1
There	1
was	1
NO	1
chemistry	1
between	1
Ben	1
Affleck	1
and	1
Sandra	1
Bullock	1
in	1
this	1
film,	1
and	1
I	1
couldn't	1
understand	1
why	1
he	1
would	1
consider	1
even	1
leaving	1
his	1
wife-to-be	1
for	1
this	1
chick	1
that	1
he	1
supposedly	1
was	1
knocked	1
out	1
by.	1
0	1
There	1
were	1
several	1
moments	1
in	1
the	1
movie	1
that	1
just	1
didn't	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
and	1
were	1
excruciatingly	1
slow	1
moving.	1
0	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
poor	1
remake	1
of	1
"My	1
Best	1
Friends	1
Wedding".	1
0	1
All	1
in	1
all,	1
a	1
great	1
disappointment.	1
0	1
I	1
cannot	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
actors	1
agreed	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
"film".	1
0	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
to	1
even	1
watch	1
it	1
for	1
very	1
long	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
losing	1
I.Q.	1

I	1
guess	1
that	1
nobody	1
at	1
the	1

that	1
aired	1
this	1
dribble	1
watched	1
it	1
before	1
putting	1

these.	1
0	1
I	1
saw	1
"Mirrormask"	1
last	1

it	1
was	1
an	1
unsatisfactory	1
experience.	1
0	1
Unfortunately,	1
inexperience	1
of	1

meant	1
that	1
scene	1
after	1
scene	1
passed	1
with	1
little	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
dramatic	1
tension	1
or	1
conflict.	1
0	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
central	1
themes	1
of	1
the	1
film	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
handled	1
ineptly,	1
stereotypically	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
depth	1
of	1
imagination.	1
0	1
All	1
the	1
pretty	1
pictures	1
in	1
the	1

cannot	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
work	1
that	1
is	1
flawed	1
at	1
the	1
core.	1
0	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
hour	1
and	1
half	1
waste	1
of	1
time,	1
following	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
very	1
pretty	1
high	1
schoolers	1
whine	1
and	1
cry	1
about	1
life.	1

You	1
can't	1
relate	1
with	1
them,	1
hell	1
you	1
barely	1
can	1
understand	1
them.	1

This	1
is	1
definitely	1
a	1
cult	1
classic	1
well	1
worth	1
viewing	1
and	1
sharing	1
with	1
others.	1
1	1
This	1
movie	1
is	1
a	1
pure	1
disaster,	1
the	1
story	1
is	1
stupid	1
and	1
the	1
editing	1
is	1
the	1
worst	1
I	1
have	1
seen,	1
it	1
confuses	1
you	1
incredibly.	1

The	1
fish	1
is	1

some	1
of	1
its	1

repeated	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
in	1
the	1

A	1
truly,	1
truly	1
bad	1
film.	1
0	1
The	1
acting	1

0	1
The	1
only	1
possible	1

this	1

I've	1
ever	1
gone	1
to	1
a	1

and	1
disliked	1
it	1
as	1
much.	1
0	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
that	1
the	1
tickets	1

I	1
would	1

mad	1
if	1

have	1
paid	1
$7.50	1
to	1
see	1
this	1
crap.	1
0	1
NOBODY	1
identifies	1
with	1
these	1
characters	1
because	1
they're	1
all	1
cardboard	1
cutouts	1
and	1
stereotypes	1
(or	1
predictably	1
reverse-stereotypes).	1

This	1
is	1
a	1
bad	1
film,	1
with	1
bad	1
writing,	1
and	1
good	1
actors....an	1
ugly	1
cartoon	1
crafted	1
by	1
Paul	1
Haggis	1
for	1
people	1
who	1
can't	1
handle	1
anything	1
but	1
the	1
bold	1
strokes	1
in	1
storytelling....a	1
picture	1
painted	1
with	1
crayons.	1
0	1
Crash	1
is	1
a	1
depressing	1
little	1
nothing,	1
that	1
provokes	1
emotion,	1
but	1
teaches	1
you	1
nothing	1
if	1
you	1
already	1
know	1
racism	1
and	1
prejudice	1
are	1
bad	1
things.	1
0	1
Still,	1
I	1
do	1
like	1
this	1
movie	1
for	1
it's	1
empowerment	1
of	1
women;	1
there's	1
not	1
enough	1
movies	1
out	1
there	1
like	1
this	1
one.	1
1	1
Your	1
brain	1
will	1
attempt	1
to	1
shut-down	1
as	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
primal	1
impulse	1
of	1
self-preservation.	1
0	1
I	1
was	1
left	1
shattered	1
from	1
the	1
experience	1

watching	1

I	1
took	1
a	1
good	1
two	1
hours	1
to	1
fully	1

This	1

now	1
joins	1
Revenge	1

it	1
again	1

this	1

An	1
excellent	1
performance	1
from	1
Ms.	1
1	1
Garbo,	1
who	1
showed	1
right	1
off	1
the	1
bat	1
that	1
her	1
talents	1
could	1
carry	1
over	1
from	1
the	1
silent	1
era	1
(I	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
some	1
of	1
her	1
silent	1
work,	1
but	1
Netflix	1
doesn't	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
stocking	1
them.	1
1	1
It's	1
also	1
great	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
renowned	1
silent	1
screenwriter	1
Frances	1
Marion	1
hasn't	1
missed	1
a	1
step	1
going	1
from	1
silent	1
to	1
sound.	1
1	1
This	1
movie	1
suffered	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
writing,	1
it	1
needed	1
more	1
suspense.	1
0	1
There	1
were	1
too	1
many	1
close	1
ups.	1
0	1
But	1
other	1
than	1
that	1
the	1
movie	1
seemed	1
to	1
drag	1
and	1
the	1
heroes	1
didn't	1
really	1
work	1
for	1
their	1

But	1
this	1

is	1
definitely	1
a	1

The	1

I	1

was	1
a	1
great	1
quality	1
film	1
for	1
it's	1

1	1
John	1
Wayne	1
did	1
an	1
incredible	1
job	1
for	1
being	1
so	1
young	1
in	1
the	1
movie	1
industry.	1
1	1
His	1
on	1
screen	1
presence	1
shined	1
thought	1
even	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
other	1
senior	1
actors	1
on	1
the	1
screen	1
with	1
him.	1
1	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
must	1
see	1
older	1
John	1
Wayne	1
film.	1
1	1
I	1
really	1
don't	1
see	1
how	1
anyone	1
could	1
enjoy	1
this	1
movie.	1
0	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
I've	1
ever	1
seen	1
a	1
movie	1
half	1
as	1
boring	1
as	1
this	1
self-indulgent	1
piece	1
of	1
junk.	1
0	1
It	1
probably	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
if	1
the	1
director	1
hadn't	1
spent	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
movie	1
showcasing	1
his	1
own	1
art	1
work,	1
which	1
really	1
isn't	1
that	1
noteworthy.	1
0	1
Another	1
thing	1
I	1
didn't	1
really	1
like	1
is	1
when	1
a	1
character	1
got	1
punched	1
in	1
the	1
face,	1
a	1
gallon	1
of	1
blood	1
would	1
spew	1
forth	1
soon	1
after.	1

Jamie	1
Foxx	1
absolutely	1
IS	1
Ray	1
Charles.	1
1	1
His	1
performance	1
is	1
simply	1
genius.	1
1	1
He	1
owns	1
the	1
film,	1
just	1
as	1
Spacek	1
owned	1
"Coal	1
Miner's	1
Daughter"	1
and	1
Quaid	1
owned	1
"Great	1
Balls	1
of	1
Fire.	1
1	1
"	1
In	1
fact,	1
it's	1
hard	1
to	1
remember	1
that	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
Ray	1
Charles	1
is	1
being	1
acted,	1
and	1
not	1
played	1
by	1
the	1
man	1
himself.	1
1	1
Ray	1
Charles	1
is	1
legendary.	1
1	1
Ray	1
Charles'	1
life	1
provided	1
excellent	1
biographical	1
material	1
for	1
the	1
film,	1
which	1
goes	1
well	1
beyond	1
being	1
just	1
another	1
movie	1
about	1
a	1
musician.	1
1	1
Hitchcock	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
director.	1
1	1
Ironically	1
I	1
mostly	1
find	1
his	1
films	1
a	1
total	1
waste	1
of	1
time	1
to	1
watch.	1
0	1
Secondly,	1
Hitchcock	1
pretty	1
much	1
perfected	1
the	1
thriller	1
and	1
chase	1
movie.	1
1	1
It's	1
this	1
pandering	1
to	1
the	1
audience	1
that	1
sabotages	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
films.	1
0	1
Hence	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
lacks	1
a	1
certain	1
energy.	1
0	1
The	1
plot	1
simply	1
rumbles	1
on	1
like	1
a	1
machine,	1
desperately	1
depending	1
on	1
the	1
addition	1
of	1
new	1
scenes.	1
0	1
There	1
are	1
the	1
usual	1
Hitchcock	1
logic	1
flaws.	1
0	1
Mishima	1
is	1
extremely	1
uninteresting.	1
0	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
chilly,	1
unremarkable	1
movie	1
about	1
an	1
author	1
living/working	1
in	1
a	1
chilly	1
abstruse	1
culture.	1
0	1
The	1
flat	1
reenactments	1
don't	1
hold	1
your	1
attention	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
emotionally	1
adrift	1
and	1
stagy.	1
0	1
And	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
it	1
just	1
sits	1
there	1
being	1
awful...	1
with	1
soldiers	1
singing	1
songs	1
about	1
the	1
masculinity	1
they	1
pledge	1
themselves	1
to,	1
hairsplitting	1
about	1
purity,	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
swords,	1
etc.	1

He	1
can	1
bore	1
you	1

quicker	1

Schrader	1
has	1
made	1
a	1
resume	1
full	1
of	1
lousy,	1
amateurish	1
films.	1
0	1
When	1
I	1
first	1
watched	1
this	1
movie,	1
in	1
the	1
80s,	1
I	1
loved	1
it.	1
1	1
I	1
was	1
totally	1
fascinated	1
by	1
the	1
music,	1
the	1
dancing...	1
everything.	1
1	1
However,	1
I	1
recently	1
watched	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
again	1
on	1
DVD,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
completely	1
struck	1
by	1
how	1
extremely	1
stupid	1
the	1
storyline	1
was	1
-	1
how	1
it	1
contained	1
holes,	1
inconsistencies	1
and	1
-	1
frankly	1
-	1
a	1
whole	1
lot	1
of	1
crap	1
-	1
and	1
how	1
horrid	1
the	1
dancing	1
was.	1
0	1
I	1
mean,	1
in	1
a	1
realistic	1
world,	1
she	1
would	1
NEVER	1
have	1
gotten	1
into	1
that	1
ballet	1
repertory...	1
The	1
whole	1
thing	1
was	1
quite	1
pathetic.	1
0	1
The	1
character	1
developments	1
also	1
lacked	1
in	1
depth.	1
0	1
Woa,	1
talk	1
about	1
awful.	1
0	1
Do	1
not	1
waste	1
your	1
time.	1
0	1
It	1
was	1
just	1
too	1
horrible.	1
0	1
The	1
worst,	1
sappiest	1
dialogue...	1
I	1
could	1
go	1
on	1
and	1
on.	1
0	1
But	1
what	1
really	1
made	1
it	1
unwatchable	1
was	1
the	1
direction.	1
0	1
The	1
poor	1
actors.	1
0	1
You	1
can't	1
even	1
tell	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
any	1
talent	1
because	1
they	1
not	1
only	1
have	1
pathetic	1
lines	1
to	1
speak	1
but	1
the	1
director	1
gave	1
them	1
no	1
action.	1
0	1
If	1
you	1
check	1
the	1
director's	1
filmography	1
on	1
this	1
site	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
why	1
this	1
film	1
didn't	1
have	1
a	1
chance.	1
0	1
This	1
would	1
not	1
even	1
be	1
good	1
as	1
a	1
made	1
for	1
TV	1
flick.	1
0	1
If	1
good	1
intentions	1
made	1
a	1
film	1
great,	1
then	1
this	1
film	1
might	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
films	1
ever	1
made.	1
1	1
The	1
film	1
has	1
great	1
actors,	1
a	1
master	1
director,	1
a	1
significant	1
theme--at	1
least	1
a	1
would-be	1
significant	1
theme,	1
undertone	1
of	1
fifties	1
existential	1
world-weariness,	1
aerial	1
scenes	1
that	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
thrilled	1
both	1
senses	1
and	1
imagination,	1
and	1
characters	1
about	1
which	1
one	1
might	1
deeply	1
care.	1
1	1
Regrettably,	1
the	1
film	1
fails.	1
0	1
The	1
movie	1
lacks	1
visual	1
interest,	1
drama,	1
expression	1
of	1
feeling,	1
and	1
celebration	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
patriotism	1
that	1
underlines	1
the	1
narrative.	1
0	1
No	1
actress	1
has	1
been	1
worse	1
used	1
that	1
June	1
Allison	1
in	1
this	1
movie.	1
0	1
Yet,	1
I	1
enjoy	1
watching	1
it.	1
1	1
Unfortunately,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
bad	1
movie	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
plain	1
bad.	1
0	1
Bad	1
script,	1
bad	1
direction	1
and	1
horrible	1
acting	1
make	1
this	1
one	1
plain	1
bad!	1
0	1
The	1
dialogue	1
sucked.	1
0	1
The	1
cinematography-if	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
called	1
that-sucked.	1
0	1
The	1
soundtrack	1
sucked.	1
0	1
The	1
acting	1
sucked.	1
0	1
The	1
concert	1
sequences	1
just	1
sucked.	1
0	1
That	1
was	1
nice.	1
1	1
That	1
was	1
funny.	1
1	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
funny.	1
1	1
Overall,	1
this	1
movie	1
was	1
cheap	1
trash.	1
0	1
But	1
this	1
movie	1
is	1
not	1
funny,	1
considering	1
the	1
ridiculousness	1
of	1
it.	1
0	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
feeling	1
angry.	1

***SPOILERS***	1
Whatever	1
else	1
can	1
(or	1
can't)	1
be	1
said	1
about	1
it,	1
SURFACE	1
is	1
superbly	1
crafted.	1
1	1
The	1
cinematography	1
is	1
simply	1
stunning	1
(to	1
say	1
the	1
least)	1
and	1
the	1
fx	1
are	1
nothing	1
if	1
not	1
state-of-the-art.	1
1	1
Conceptually,	1
the	1
show	1
offers	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
of	1
everything-	1
and	1
for	1
just	1
about	1
everybody	1
(parents,	1
kids,	1
fantasy	1
and/or	1
fx	1
fans).	1
1	1
And	1
there	1
wasn't	1
a	1
single	1
sour	1
note	1
struck	1
acting-wise,	1
either;	1
some	1
surprisingly	1
solid	1
casting,	1
here.	1
1	1
All	1
things	1
considered,	1
a	1
job	1
very	1
well	1
done.	1
1	1
Thanks	1
good	1
a	1
movie	1
like	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
and	1
released.	1
1	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
mexican	1
movies	1
ever!,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
less	1
understood,	1
even	1
by	1
mexican	1
themselves,	1
no	1
matter	1
how	1
identified	1
the	1
should	1
have	1
felt	1
with	1
it.	1
1	1
It	1
ranks	1
highly	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
noir-crime-drama,	1
incredible	1
performances	1
by	1
Belmondo	1
and	1
Lino	1
Ventura.	1
1	1
The	1
attention	1
given	1
to	1
every	1
character,	1
and	1
complex	1
psychological	1
portrayals,	1
detailing	1
loyalty,	1
treachery,	1
love,	1
and	1
hope,	1
are	1
tremendous.	1
1	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
drama,	1
an	1
excellent	1
thriller,	1
and	1
an	1
excellent	1
film.	1
1	1
Up	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
Melville.	1
1	1
Everything	1
about	1
this	1
film	1
is	1
simply	1
incredible.	1
1	1
You	1
truly	1
take	1
this	1
journey	1
through	1
the	1
eyes	1
and	1
soul	1
of	1
a	1
child.	1
1	1
BLACK	1
WATER	1
is	1
a	1
thriller	1
that	1
manages	1
to	1
completely	1
transcend	1
it's	1
limitations	1
(it's	1
an	1
indie	1
flick)	1
by	1
continually	1
subverting	1
expectations	1
to	1
emerge	1
as	1
an	1
intense	1
experience.	1
1	1
The	1
performances	1
are	1
real	1
and	1
gripping,	1
the	1
crocdodile	1
is	1
extremely	1
well	1
done,	1
indeed	1
if	1
the	1
Black	1
Water	1
website	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
believed	1
that's	1
because	1
they	1
used	1
real	1
crocs	1
and	1
the	1
swamp	1
location	1
is	1
fabulous.	1
1	1
I	1
thoroughly	1
enjoyed	1
it	1
when	1
Christopher	1
Eccleston	1
took	1
control	1
of	1
the	1
TARDIS	1
and	1
the	1
continuation	1
of	1
the	1
series.	1
1	1
I'm	1
not	1
sure	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
this	1
film.	1
0	1
If	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
turn	1
my	1
good	1
day	1
feeling	1
into	1
a	1
night	1
of	1
disturbing	1
memories	1
than	1
I	1
guess	1
he	1
succeeded.	1
0	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
beautiful	1
places.	1
1	1
It	1
was	1
forced,	1
like	1
everything	1
in	1
this	1
movie.	1

Again,	1

An	1

finale	1

possibly	1
the	1
BEST	1
trilogy	1
of	1
all	1
time!	1
1	1
Kieslowski	1
never	1
ceases	1
to	1
amaze	1
me.	1
1	1
He	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
favourite	1
directors,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
talented	1
directors	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
cinema.	1
1	1
His	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
colours	1
of	1
the	1
French	1
flag	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
films	1
was	1
nothing	1
short	1
of	1
incredible,	1
every	1
shot,	1
every	1
scene	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
work	1
of	1
art.	1
1	1
Three	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
visually	1
appealing	1
movies	1
i've	1
ever	1
seen.	1
1	1
And	1
his	1
subtle	1
connections	1
between	1
the	1
three	1
films	1
are	1
awesome.	1
1	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
mention	1
this	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
huge	1
SPOILER,	1
i	1
loved	1
the	1
ending,	1
how	1
all	1
the	1
characters	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
films	1
were	1
the	1
remaining	1
survivors	1
of	1
the	1
ferry	1
disaster,	1
with	1
Valentine	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
judge	1
together,	1
and	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
watching	1
it	1
on	1
her	1
TV,	1
solidifying	1
his	1
happiness	1
over	1
the	1
suffering	1
which	1
he	1
dealt	1
with	1
for	1
those	1
many	1
years.	1
1	1
I	1
couldn't	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
way	1
to	1
end	1
the	1
film,	1
but	1
a	1
smile	1
on	1
my	1
face,	1
great	1
way	1
to	1
wrap	1
up	1
an	1
amazing	1
film	1
and	1
trilogy!	1
1	1
I	1
recommend	1
this	1
for	1
EVERYONE	1
who	1
loves	1
film,	1
movies,	1
anything...A	1
Work	1
of	1
Art!	1
1	1
10	1
out	1
of	1
10	1
for	1
both	1
the	1
movie	1
and	1
trilogy.	1
1	1
I	1
literally	1
vomited	1
while	1
watching	1
this	1
film.	1
0	1
I	1
think	1
i	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
found	1
this	1
another	1
one	1
of	1
roth's	1
pearls.	1
1	1
his	1
performance,	1
as	1
awarded,	1
was	1
stunning.	1
1	1
the	1
story	1
which	1
was	1
told	1
so	1
eloquently	1
by	1
Francis	1
ford	1
Coppola	1
25	1
years	1
earlier,	1
really	1
unfolds	1
gradually	1
and	1
leaves	1
room	1
for	1
the	1
characters	1
to	1
develop.	1
1	1
In	1
a	1
most	1
wonderful	1
location	1
lies	1
a	1
story	1
of	1
contrast.	1
1	1
All	1
in	1
all	1
a	1
beautiful	1
directed	1
film	1
from	1
Nicola's	1
roeg	1
wih	1
a	1
sublime	1
cast.	1
1	1
I'm	1
translating	1
movies	1
for	1
a	1
living	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
movie	1
in	1
my	1
5-year	1
working	1
experience	1
that	1
I	1
found	1
offensive	1
to	1
my	1
intelligence.	1
0	1
But	1
when	1
someone	1
strives	1
for	1
greatness	1
and	1
poetry,	1
but	1
delivers	1
a	1
muddled	1
(and	1
often	1
ridiculous)	1
story,	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
disparate	1
scenes,	1
pretentious	1
dialogue...	1
Then	1
you	1
get	1
the	1
worst	1
kind	1
of	1
a	1
movie	1
that	1
some	1
other	1
reviewer	1
very	1
accurately	1
defined	1
as	1
"pretentious	1
crap".	1
0	1
To	1
those	1
who	1
find	1
this	1
movie	1
intelligent	1
or	1
even	1
masterful,	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
say	1
-	1
it's	1
your	1
intelligence	1
and	1
your	1
imagination	1
you	1
obviously	1
used	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
make	1
some	1
sense	1
of	1
this	1
pitiful	1
attempt	1
(it's	1
in	1
our	1
human	1
nature	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
make	1
sense	1
of	1
things)	1
.	1
0	1
One	1
more	1
thing:	1
I	1
can	1
tolerate	1
political	1
incorrectness	1
very	1
well,	1
I'm	1
all	1
for	1
artistic	1
freedom	1
and	1
suspension	1
of	1
disbelief,	1
but	1
the	1
Slavic	1
female	1
character	1
was	1
just	1
too	1
much.	1
0	1
This	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
fun	1
and	1
funny	1
movie.	1
1	1
Highly	1
entertaining	1
at	1
all	1
angles.	1
1	1
It	1
features	1
an	1
outlandish	1
array	1
of	1
memorable,	1
psychotic	1
but	1
lovable	1
nuts.	1
1	1
So	1
for	1
our	1
enjoyment	1
we	1
get	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
run	1
around,	1
play	1
games,	1
and	1
be	1
dangerous.	1
1	1
It	1
even	1
has	1
its	1
sweet	1
moments.	1
1	1
The	1
telephone	1
repair	1
man	1
was	1
really	1
funny	1
and	1
his	1
reactions	1
to	1
the	1
nuts	1
and	1
bitchy	1
boss	1
were	1
truly	1
genuine.	1
1	1
All	1
the	1
characters	1
in	1
this	1
film	1
are	1
tremendously	1
well	1
played.	1
1	1
And	1
I	1
really	1
did	1
find	1
them	1
funny.	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
actually	1
a	1
very	1
smart	1
movie.	1
1	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
brilliant	1
twist	1
ending.	1
1	1
"	1
I	1
love	1
it.	1
1	1
The	1
ending	1
is	1
so,	1
SO	1
perfect...	1
you'll	1
shed	1
a	1
tear.	1
1	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
thrilled	1
after	1
seeing	1
a	1
movie	1
like	1
this.	1
1	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
forget	1
it	1
now.	1
1	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
just	1
a	1
cult...	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
cult	1
CLASSIC.	1
1	1
Which	1
has	1
more	1
depth	1
and	1
character	1
than	1
the	1
man	1
underneath	1
it.	1
0	1
The	1
Malta	1
settings	1
are	1
as	1
dry	1
and	1
as	1
barren	1
as	1
the	1
dialogue.	1
0	1
This	1
movie	1
is	1
terrible.	1
0	1
The	1
hockey	1
scenes	1
are	1
terrible,	1
defensemen	1
playing	1
like	1
they're	1
5	1
years	1
old,	1
goalies	1
diving	1
at	1
shots	1
that	1
are	1
10	1

wide	1

the	1
net,	1

For	1

that	1
haven't	1

it,	1
don't	1
waste	1

To	1

In	1
particular	1
the	1
relationship	1

the	1

just	1
didn't	1
work	1
for	1
me	1
at	1
all.	1
0	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
superficial	1
movie	1
and	1
it	1
gave	1

that	1
I	1
was	1
watching	1
play	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
film.	1

'stagey'	1
and	1
the	1
storyline	1
was	1
a	1
lot	1
like	1
a	1
stage	1
farce.	1

By	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
pyromaniac	1
waylaid	1
the	1
assistant	1
I	1
was	1
bored	1
and	1
didn't	1
care	1
what	1
happened	1
next	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
switched	1
off.	1
0	1
Glad	1
I	1
didn't	1
pay	1
to	1
see	1
it.	1

Didn't	1
laugh	1
or	1
even	1
smile	1
once.	1

But	1
it	1
wasn't	1
anything	1
at	1
all	1
just	1
one	1
big	1
yawn...	1

It	1
is	1
a	1
really	1
good	1
show	1
to	1
watch.	1
1	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
educational	1
for	1
children	1
1	1
to	1
8	1
years	1
old.	1
1	1
Barney	1
is	1
definitely	1
super	1
DE	1
duper.	1
1	1
is	1
pretty	1
funny.	1
1	1
Babie	1
Bop	1
is	1
very	1
cute.	1
1	1
The	1
kids	1
are	1
very	1
cool	1
too.	1
1	1
"	1
But	1
"Storm	1
Trooper"	1
is	1
not	1
even	1
bad	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
wonderfully	1
terrible	1
movies.	1
0	1
It's	1
just	1
lame.	1

The	1

it	1
right.	1

Everything	1
about	1
this	1
movie	1
is	1
stupid.	1
0	1
Even	1
if	1
you	1
love	1
bad	1
movies,	1
do	1
not	1
watch	1
this	1
movie.	1
0	1
It	1
is	1
shameful.	1
0	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
this	1
television	1
series	1
a	1
10	1
plus	1
if	1
i	1
could.	1
1	1
The	1
writers	1
were	1
"smack	1
on"	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
best	1
actors	1
and	1
actresses	1
were	1
a	1
bonus	1
to	1
the	1
show.These	1
characters	1
were	1
so	1
real.	1
1	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
I	1
have	1
taped	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
episodes	1
and	1
i	1
find	1
myself	1
watching	1
them	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again.	1
1	1
Now	1
you	1
know	1
why	1
I	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
10+!	1
1	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
exactly	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
about	1
this	1
movie,	1
but	1
we	1
latched	1
on	1
to	1
this	1
endearing	1
movie	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
become	1
a	1
special	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
family's	1
memories.	1
1	1
I	1
totally	1
and	1
absolutely	1
recommend	1
this	1
movie	1
to	1
anyone	1
who	1
likes	1
good	1
wholesome	1
family	1
movies	1
because	1
that	1
is	1
exactly	1
what	1
this	1
is.	1
1	1
The	1
things	1
that	1
the	1
four	1
kids	1
get	1
themselves	1
into	1
is	1
absolutely	1
hilarious	1
to	1
watch.	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
movies	1
out	1
there	1
that	1
shows	1
such	1
strong	1
sibling	1
bond	1
for	1
each	1
other.	1
1	1
Much	1
more	1
interesting,	1
more	1
action,	1
more	1
suspense,	1
and	1
less	1
of	1
the	1
unneeded	1
controversy.	1
1	1
Everything	1
from	1
acting	1
to	1
cinematography	1
was	1
solid.	1
1	1
Definitely	1
worth	1
checking	1
out.	1
1	1
Damian	1
is	1
so	1
talented	1
and	1
versatile	1
in	1
so	1
many	1
ways	1
of	1
writing	1
and	1
portraying	1
different	1
Characters	1
on	1
screen.	1
1	1
This	1
movie	1
has	1
a	1
cutting	1
edge	1
to	1
it.	1
1	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
pleased	1
to	1
know	1
such	1
a	1
modern	1
day	1
genius	1
is	1
out	1
there	1
,	1
letting	1
is	1
passion	1
for	1
Art	1
drive	1
him	1
and	1
taking	1
us	1
as	1
an	1
audience	1
with	1
him.	1
1	1
The	1
new	1
characters	1
weren't	1
all	1
that	1
memorable,	1
and	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
forgetting	1
who	1
was	1
who.	1
0	1
I	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
her	1
going	1
to	1
Ireland	1
did	1
absolutely	1
nothing	1
whatsoever.	1
0	1
It	1
didn't	1
make	1
me	1
scared,	1
horrified,	1
or	1
make	1
me	1
sympathetic	1
towards	1
the	1
characters;	1
it	1
was	1
simply	1
annoying.	1
0	1
The	1
jerky	1
camera	1
movements	1
were	1
also	1
annoying.	1
0	1
The	1
plot	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
pretty	1
much	1
every	1
other	1
cheap	1
horror.	1
0	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
few	1
pathetic	1
attempts	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
characters	1
some	1
depth,	1
but	1
it	1
didn't	1
really	1
work	1
into	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
plot.	1
0	1
I	1
guess	1
it	1
was	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
clever	1
twist,	1
then	1
shed	1
some	1
light	1
on	1
the	1
situation,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
stupid.	1
0	1
If	1
you	1
see	1
it,	1
you	1
should	1
probably	1
just	1
leave	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
shelf.	1

Elias	1
Koteas,Jack	1

Drago	1

in	1

and	1
is	1
cool	1
as	1
usual	1
+	1
a	1
cameo	1
by	1
Sven	1
ole	1
Thorsen	1
helps	1
make	1
this	1
a	1
very	1
enjoyable	1
movie	1
with	1
good	1
acting	1
and	1
a	1
decent	1
budget.	1
1	1
This	1
was	1
such	1
an	1
awesome	1
movie	1
that	1
i	1
bought	1
it	1
off	1
of	1
Ebay.	1
1	1
I	1
really	1
loved	1
the	1
story	1
line	1
and	1
the	1
poler	1
bear	1
was	1
kinda	1
cute.But	1
if	1
anyone	1
has	1
a	1
question	1
about	1
Fort	1
Steele,	1
just	1
ask	1
away:)	1
1	1
This	1
totally	1
UNfunny	1
movie	1
is	1
so	1
over	1
the	1
top	1
and	1
pathetic	1
and	1
unrealistic	1
that	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
90	1
minutes	1
of	1
utter	1
torture	1
I	1
probably	1
looked	1
at	1
my	1
watch	1
about	1
70000	1
times!	1
0	1
Lucy	1
Bell	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
higher	1
than	1
this	1
crap	1
and	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
sink	1
this	1
low	1
is	1
quite	1
depressing.	1
0	1
All	1
this	1
movie	1
does	1
is	1
make	1
you	1
sick	1
watching	1
all	1
these	1
slackers	1
make	1
excuses	1
for	1
their	1
stupid	1
actions	1
for	1
90	1
minutes.	1
0	1
God,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
never	1
get	1
that	1
90	1
minutes	1
back!	1
0	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
most	1
wonderful	1
parts	1
(literally,	1
full	1
of	1
"wonder")	1
are	1
the	1
excerpts	1
from	1
his	1
works.	1
1	1
The	1
sets	1
(especially	1
designed	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
the	1
camera)	1
are	1
amazing....stylized,	1
beautiful	1
and	1
effective.	1
1	1
They	1
could	1
be	1
used	1
as	1
exemplars	1
for	1
any	1
set	1
designer.	1
1	1
The	1
stories	1
were	1
powerful	1
explorations	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
man	1
and	1
of	1
art.	1
1	1
After	1
watching	1
this	1
film,	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
learn	1
more	1
about	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
this	1
artist.	1
1	1
I	1
highly	1
recommend	1
this	1
movie	1
for	1
anyone	1
interested	1
in	1
art,	1
poetry,	1
theater,	1
politics,	1
or	1
Japanese	1
history.	1
1	1
Here,	1
in	1
The	1
Wind	1
and	1
the	1
Lion,	1
we	1
see	1
a	1
wonderful	1
rendering	1
of	1
America's	1
own	1
Imperial	1
age.	1
1	1
)	1
What	1
makes	1
this	1
story	1
different	1
are	1
the	1
terrific	1
production	1
values	1
-	1
faultless	1
photography,	1
composition	1
and	1
editing	1
-	1
the	1
terrific	1
casting	1
-	1
the	1
underappreciated	1
Brian	1
Keith	1
playing	1
a	1
bully	1
Teddy	1
-	1
and	1
vivid	1
history.	1
1	1
Though	1
The	1
Wind	1
and	1
the	1
Lion	1
is	1
told	1
largely	1
through	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
son,	1
every	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
can	1
identify	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
characters,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
Sean	1
Connery's	1
noble	1
brigand,	1
Candace	1
Bergen's	1
feisty	1
heroine,	1
John	1
Huston's	1
wily	1
John	1
Hay	1
or	1
Steve	1
Kanaly's	1
spiffy,	1
radiant,	1
ruthless	1
can-do	1
lieutenant,	1
Roosevelt's	1
"Big	1
Stick".	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
high	1
adventure	1
at	1
its	1
best.	1
1	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
Robert	1
Ryans	1
best	1
film,	1
because	1
he	1
portrayed	1
someone	1
like	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
schizophrenic	1
in	1
real	1
life,(my	1
father)	1
although	1
he	1
never	1
murdered	1
anyone	1
but	1
was	1
affected	1
more	1
so	1
during	1
the	1
second	1
world	1
war	1
which	1
made	1
him	1
worse.	1
1	1
Having	1
to	1
humour	1
him	1
just	1
to	1
get	1
by	1
and	1
get	1
through	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
so	1
apt.	1
1	1
(My	1
mother	1
and	1
brother	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
this)When	1
I	1
saw	1
Robert	1
Ryan	1
portraying	1
this	1
type	1
of	1
man,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
imitation	1
of	1
this	1
type	1
of	1
individual,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
impressed.	1
1	1
Almost	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
songs	1
in	1
Cover	1
Girl	1
are	1
old-fashioned	1
and	1
not	1
very	1
tuneful.	1
0	1
The	1
most	1
annoying	1
thing	1
about	1
'Cover	1
Girl'	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
Rita	1
Hayworth	1
is	1
put	1
up	1
on	1
a	1
pedestal.	1
0	1
Unfortunately,	1
'Cover	1
Girl'	1
is	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
how	1
Hollywood	1
used	1
to	1
exploit	1
women	1
for	1
financial	1
gain.	1
0	1
Non-linear	1
narration	1
thus	1
many	1
flashbacks	1
and	1
every	1
part	1
are	1
articulated	1
quite	1
well.	1
1	1
The	1
good	1
cinematography	1
also	1
makes	1
her	1
and	1
Monica	1
Bellucci	1
look	1
very	1
beautiful.	1
1	1
A	1
good	1
commentary	1
of	1
today's	1
love	1
and	1
undoubtedly	1
a	1
film	1
worth	1
seeing.	1
1	1
For	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
first	1
timers	1
in	1
film	1
making,	1
I	1
think	1
they	1
did	1
an	1
excellent	1
job!!	1
1	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
popular	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
cinema,	1
a	1
good	1
house	1
and	1
very	1
good	1
reactions	1
and	1
plenty	1
of	1
laughs.	1
1	1
It's	1
a	1
feel-good	1
film	1
and	1
that's	1
how	1
I	1
felt	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cinema!	1
1	1
It	1
has	1
northern	1
humour	1
and	1
positive	1
about	1
the	1
community	1
it	1
represents.	1
1	1
I	1
rather	1
enjoyed	1
it.	1
1	1
I	1
liked	1
it.	1
1	1
I	1
couldn't	1
take	1
them	1
seriously.	1
0	1
It	1
really	1
created	1
a	1
unique	1
feeling	1
though.	1
1	1
Vivian	1
Schilling	1
did	1
an	1
excellent	1
job	1
with	1
the	1
script.	1
1	1
A	1
world	1
better	1
than	1
95%	1
of	1
the	1
garbage	1
in	1
the	1
theatres	1
today.	1
1	1
Her	1
role	1
was	1
played	1
well.	1
1	1
Not	1
too	1
screamy	1
not	1
to	1
masculine	1
but	1
just	1
right.	1
1	1
The	1
camera	1
really	1
likes	1
her	1
in	1
this	1
movie.	1
1	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
casted	1
her	1
in	1
that	1
role	1
after	1
ready	1
the	1
script.	1
1	1
As	1
a	1
European,	1
the	1
movie	1
is	1
a	1
nice	1
throwback	1
to	1
my	1
time	1
as	1
a	1
student	1
in	1
the	1
1980's	1
and	1
the	1
experiences	1
I	1
had	1
living	1
abroad	1
and	1
interacting	1
with	1
other	1
nationalities,	1
although	1
the	1
circumstances	1
were	1
slightly	1
different.	1
1	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
fan	1
of	1
his	1
...	1
This	1
movie	1
sucked	1
really	1
bad.	1
0	1
Even	1
worse	1
than	1
Ticker!	1

&	1
That	1
movie	1
was	1
bad.	1

like	1

singing	1
'Ive	1
Never	1

totally	1
recommend	1
this	1
movie,its	1
coming	1
out	1
on	1
special	1
edition	1
on	1
June	1
20.The	1
cover	1
has	1
scamp	1
on	1
a	1
garbage	1
can	1
and	1
Angel	1
underneath	1
the	1
lid.	1
1	1
I	1
just	1
cant	1
explain	1
this	1
movie	1
more	1
than	1
romantic,charming,hilarious,and	1
adorable.The	1
junkyard	1
scenes	1
are	1
funny,all	1
the	1
junkyard	1
dogs	1
have	1
something	1
special.Too	1
funny	1
i	1
laughed,kids	1
will	1
LOVE	1
it.Buy	1
it	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
out,it	1
has	1
new	1
features!	1
1	1
Now	1
we	1
were	1
chosen	1
to	1
be	1
tortured	1
with	1
this	1
disgusting	1
piece	1
of	1
blatant	1
American	1
propaganda.	1
0	1
This	1
show	1
is	1
made	1
for	1
Americans	1
-	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
stupid	1
and	1
full	1
with	1
hatred	1
and	1
clichés	1
to	1
be	1
admitted	1
elsewhere.	1
0	1
Almost	1
everyone	1
involved	1
must	1
be	1
return	1
to	1
school,	1
acting	1
is	1
utterly	1
predictable	1
and	1
bad,	1
script	1
is	1
pile	1
of	1
garbage	1
all	1
round.	1
0	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
enter	1
negative	1
values,	1
admins?	1
0	1
The	1
sets	1
are	1
so	1
bad,	1
they	1
wouldn't	1
look	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
on	1
a	1
Thunderbirds	1
episode.	1
0	1
The	1
use	1
of	1
slow-motion	1
needlessly	1
repeats	1
itself	1
throughout	1
the	1
movie	1
but	1
is	1
well	1
backed	1
up	1
by	1
bad	1
acting	1
(and	1
bad	1
is	1
a	1
kind	1
word	1
here),	1
no	1
continuity,	1
scenes	1
that	1
are	1
thrown	1

vehicles	1
that	1
looked	1
like	1
they	1
were	1
made	1
from	1
a	1
Corn	1
Flakes	1
box	1
and	1
a	1
directorial	1
style	1
that	1
bordered	1
on	1
stupidity.	1
0	1
Oh	1
yeah,	1
and	1
the	1
storyline	1
was	1
pathetic	1
too.	1
0	1
I	1
hate	1
writing	1
bad	1
reviews	1
about	1
films	1
-	1
especially	1
those	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
really	1
like	1
the	1
star	1
-	1
but	1
this	1
film	1
is	1
so	1
bad	1
I	1
don't	1
believe	1
for	1
one	1
second	1
that	1
anyone	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
proud	1
of	1
it.	1
0	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
filmmaker	1
nor	1
am	1
I	1
a	1
director	1
but	1
I	1
would	1
hide	1
my	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
sand	1
if	1
I'd	1
spent	1
whatever	1
amount	1
of	1
money	1
and	1
time	1
on	1
this	1
movie.	1
0	1
In	1
short	1
-	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
monumental	1
waste	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
energy	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
recommend	1
anyone	1
to	1
EVER	1
see	1
this	1
film.	1
0	1
It	1
came	1
free	1
with	1
a	1
DVD	1
player	1
I	1
bought	1
but	1
I	1
still	1
turned	1
the	1
thing	1
off	1
halfway	1
through	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
embarrassed	1
for	1
Howell.	1
0	1
1/10	1
-	1
and	1
only	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
setting	1
for	1
0/10.	1
0	1
An	1
interesting	1
premise,	1
and	1
Billy	1
Drago	1
is	1
always	1
good	1
as	1
a	1
dangerous	1
nut-bag	1
(side	1
note:	1
I'd	1
love	1
to	1
see	1
Drago,	1
Stephen	1
McHattie	1
and	1
Lance	1
Hendrikson	1
in	1
a	1
flick	1
together;	1
talk	1
about	1
raging	1
cheekbones!).	1
1	1
The	1
soundtrack	1
wasn't	1
terrible,	1
either.	1
1	1
But	1
the	1
acting--even	1
that	1
of	1
such	1
professionals	1
as	1
Drago	1
and	1
Debbie	1
Rochon--was	1
terrible,	1
the	1
directing	1
worse	1
(perhaps	1
contributory	1
to	1
the	1
former),	1
the	1
dialog	1
chimp-like,	1
and	1
the	1
camera	1
work,	1
barely	1
tolerable.	1
0	1
Still,	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
SETS	1
that	1
got	1
a	1
big	1
"10"	1
on	1
my	1
"oy-vey"	1
scale.	1
1	1
Yes,	1
I	1
am	1
simplifying	1
things	1
here	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
brevity,	1
for	1
this	1
really	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
core	1
of	1
the	1
problems	1
with	1
this	1
film	1
-	1
it	1
has	1
too	1
much	1
going	1
on	1
without	1
any	1
real,	1
fulfilling	1
explanation.	1
0	1
Both	1
do	1
good	1
jobs	1
and	1
are	1
quite	1
amusing.	1
1	1
But	1
the	1
convoluted	1
plot	1
just	1
didn't	1
convince	1
me,	1
and	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
film	1
was	1
watched	1
with	1
a	1
weird,	1
questioning	1
glance.	1
0	1
I	1
let	1
my	1
girlfriend	1
talk	1
me	1
into	1
seeing	1
this	1
-	1
bad	1
idea,	1
we	1
both	1
hated	1
it.	1
0	1
The	1
last	1
15	1
minutes	1
of	1
movie	1
are	1
also	1
not	1
bad	1
as	1
well.	1
1	1
Bela	1
Lugosi	1
was	1
totally	1
extraneous,	1
intoning	1
odd	1
lines.	1
0	1
The	1
acting	1
was	1
decidely	1
wooden,	1
though	1
no	1
worse	1
than	1
a	1
period	1
Universal	1
B	1
movie.	1
0	1
I	1
like	1
Armand	1
Assante	1
&	1
my	1
cable	1
company's	1
summary	1
sounded	1
interesting,	1
so	1
I	1
watched	1
it,	1
twice	1
already,	1
and	1
probably	1
will	1
again.	1
1	1
I	1
believe	1
the	1
screenwriter	1
did	1
a	1
good	1
job	1
of	1
tying	1
up	1
the	1
loose	1
ends.	1
1	1
My	1
8/10	1
score	1
is	1
mostly	1
for	1
the	1
plot.	1
1	1
I	1
won't	1
say	1
any	1
more	1
-	1
I	1
don't	1
like	1
spoilers,	1
so	1
I	1
don't	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
one,	1
but	1
I	1
believe	1
this	1
film	1
is	1
worth	1
your	1
time.	1
1	1
Wow,	1
what	1
a	1
bad	1
film.	1
0	1
Not	1
frightening	1
in	1
the	1
least,	1
and	1
barely	1
comprehensible.	1
0	1
The	1
plot	1
doesn't	1
hang	1
together	1
at	1
all,	1
and	1
the	1
acting	1
is	1
absolutely	1
appalling.	1
0	1
Not	1
even	1
good	1
for	1
camp	1
value!	1
0	1
I	1
wasn't	1
expecting	1
Oscar	1
material,	1
but	1
this?	1
0	1
You'd	1
have	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
IQ	1
of	1
particularly	1
stupid	1
mollusk	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
one	1
coming.	1
0	1
This	1
film	1
(and	1
I	1
use	1
that	1
word	1
loosely)	1
is	1
an	1
insult	1
to	1
the	1
movie-going	1
public.	1
0	1
If	1
only	1
someone	1
involved	1
with	1
it	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
string	1
together	1
narrative!	1
0	1
This	1
gets	1
a	1
1	1
out	1
of	1
10,	1
simply	1
because	1
there's	1
nothing	1
lower.	1
0	1
This	1
is	1
one	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
have,	1
but	1
I	1
watched	1
it	1
recently	1
on	1
Fox	1
Movie	1
Channel,	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
disappointed.	1
0	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
contract	1
player	1
with	1
little	1
control	1
over	1
his	1
scripts,	1
but	1
the	1
acting	1
was	1
as	1
bad	1
as	1
the	1
script.	1
0	1
Victor	1
McLaglen	1
was	1
even	1
bad,	1
and	1
Brian	1
DonLevy	1
was	1
almost	1
unrecognizable.	1
0	1
Considering	1
the	1
relations	1
off	1
screen	1
between	1
Taylor	1
and	1
Stanwyck,	1
it	1
was	1
surprising	1
how	1
little	1
chemistry	1
there	1
was	1
on	1
screen	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
of	1
them.	1
0	1
But	1
the	1
premise	1
of	1
the	1
film	1
was	1
so	1
ridiculous:	1
that	1
the	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
U.S.	1
0	1
The	1
death	1
row	1
scenes	1
were	1
entirely	1
unmoving.	1
0	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
worse	1
than	1
Taylor's	1
acting	1
was	1
Stanwyck's	1
singing.	1
0	1
Whatever	1
the	1
producer	1
was	1
going	1
for,	1
he	1
missed	1
entirely.	1
0	1
I	1
was	1
deeply	1
impressed	1
with	1
the	1
character	1
he	1
played.	1
1	1
I	1
knew	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
film	1
that	1
more	1
great	1
things	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
this	1
gifted	1
actor.	1
1	1
A	1
cheap	1
and	1
cheerless	1
heist	1
movie	1
with	1
poor	1
characterisation,	1
lots	1
of	1
underbite	1
style	1
stoic	1
emoting	1
(think	1
Chow	1
Yun	1
Fat	1
in	1
A	1
Better	1
Tomorrow)	1
and	1
some	1
cheesy	1
clichés	1
thrown	1
into	1
an	1
abandoned	1
factory	1
ready	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
poorly	1
executed	1
flying	1
judo	1
rolls	1
a	1
la	1
John	1
Woo.	1
0	1
Even	1
the	1
squibs	1
look	1
awful.	1
0	1
At	1
no	1
point	1
in	1
the	1
proceedings	1
does	1
it	1
look	1
remotely	1
like	1
America.	1
0	1
The	1
plot,	1
such	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
is	1
so	1
derivative	1
and	1
predictable	1
that	1
the	1
ending	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
mercy	1
killing.	1
0	1
The	1
awful	1
dialogue	1
and	1
hopeless	1
overacting	1
by	1
everyone	1
who	1
gets	1
shot	1
top	1
off	1
a	1
real	1
waste	1
of	1
space	1
and	1
time.	1
0	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
uneasy	1
with	1
how	1
bad	1
this	1
movie	1
was,	1
but	1
not	1
scared	1
at	1
all.	1
0	1
The	1
dialogue	1
is	1
composed	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
make	1
little	1
sense.	1
0	1
About	1
30	1
minutes	1
of	1
footage	1
is	1
wasted	1
to	1
show	1
mediocre	1
elderly	1
actors	1
awkwardly	1
babbling	1
overwrought	1
pseudo-Satanic	1
gibberish	1
corny	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
teen	1
Goth	1
blush,	1
almost	1
always	1
in	1
Olde	1
English,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
in	1
Latin	1
that	1
may	1
or	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
made	1
up	1
words.	1
0	1
The	1
directing	1
is	1
sloppy	1
at	1
best.	1
0	1
Hackneyed	1
writing,	1
certainly,	1
but	1
made	1
even	1
worse	1
by	1
the	1
bad	1
directing.	1
0	1
Of	1
course,	1
the	1
acting	1
is	1
blah.	1
0	1
The	1
acting	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
cast	1
could	1
be	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
scale	1
and	1
balanced	1
perfectly	1
between	1
overacting	1
and	1
underacting.	1
0	1
And,	1
FINALLY,	1
after	1
all	1
that,	1
we	1
get	1
to	1
an	1
ending	1
that	1
would've	1
been	1
great	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
handled	1
by	1
competent	1
people	1
and	1
not	1
Jerry	1
Falwell.	1
0	1
I	1
loved	1
this	1
movie	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
portrayal	1
of	1
a	1
family	1
who	1
had	1
it's	1
share	1
of	1
ups	1
and	1
down,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
special	1
love	1
they	1
had	1
for	1
each	1
other.	1
1	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
many	1
movies	1
starring	1
Jaclyn	1
Smith,	1
but	1
my	1
god	1
this	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
best,	1
though	1
it	1
came	1
out	1
12	1
years	1
ago.	1
1	1
This	1
movie	1
contained	1
an	1
all-star	1
cast,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
loved	1
the	1
most	1
was	1
that	1
it	1
opened	1
my	1
eyes	1
to	1
see	1
other	1
actors	1
who	1
I	1
haven't	1
seen	1
before.	1
1	1
This	1
movie	1
was	1
kind	1
of	1
long	1
in	1
length,	1
but	1
I	1
enjoyed	1
every	1
minute	1
of	1
it.	1
1	1
Overall	1
I	1
rate	1
this	1
movie	1
a	1
10	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
1-10	1
scale.	1
1	1
Lifetime	1
does	1
not	1
air	1
it	1
enough,	1
so	1
if	1
anyone	1
knows	1
what	1
store	1
sells	1
it	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
because	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
must-have.	1
1	1
I	1
particularly	1
remember	1
my	1
senses	1
being	1
assaulted	1
by	1
strident	1
cords	1
of	1
music	1
that	1
would	1
blare	1
out	1
with	1
very	1
little	1
warning,	1
and	1
even	1
less	1
meaning.	1
0	1
It	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
pap	1
that	1
is	1
screened	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
unemployed	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
jobs.	1
0	1
Totally	1
different,	1
with	1
loads	1
of	1
understatement	1
and	1
black	1
comedy,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
film	1
few	1
get	1
to	1
see,	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
do	1
will	1
remember	1
it.	1
1	1
This	1
movie	1
creates	1
its	1
own	1
universe,	1
and	1
is	1
fascinating	1
in	1
every	1
way.	1
1	1
But	1
this	1
movie	1
really	1
got	1
to	1
me.	1
1	1
See	1
it.	1
1	1
I	1
really	1
hope	1
the	1
team	1
behind	1
this	1
movie	1
makes	1
more	1
movies,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
continue	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
in	1
their	1
own,	1
some	1
kinda	1
weird	1
style.	1
1	1
And	1
I	1
forgot:	1
The	1
Casting	1
here	1
i	1
superb,	1
with	1
Trond	1
Fausa	1
Aurvåg	1
being	1
perfect	1
in	1
the	1
role	1
as	1
the	1
Bothersome	1
Man,	1
who	1
doesn't	1
understand	1
where	1
he	1
is,	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
doing	1
and	1
why.	1
1	1
This	1
movie	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
and	1
humorous	1
comment	1
on	1
life	1
in	1
2006.	1
1	1
I	1
found	1
this	1
move	1
beautiful,	1
enjoyable,	1
and	1
uplifting.	1
1	1
Initially	1
the	1
local	1
sites	1
in	1
the	1
film,	1
which	1
was	1
filmed	1
here	1
in	1
Buffalo,	1
intrigued	1
me.	1
1	1
Later	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
film.	1
1	1
The	1
entire	1
audience	1
applauded	1
at	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
the	1
film.	1
1	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
theater	1
with	1
a	1
lilt	1
in	1
my	1
step,	1
joy	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
hope	1
for	1
the	1
human	1
race.	1
1	1
Duris	1
has	1
a	1
wholesome	1
appearance	1
and	1
gives	1
a	1
fine	1
performance.	1
1	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
cast	1
also	1
play	1
well.	1
1	1
Cinematography	1
noteworthy	1
including	1
fine	1
views	1
of	1
Barcelona	1
and	1
its	1
famed	1
Gaudi	1
towers.	1
1	1
About	1
ten	1
minutes	1
into	1
this	1
film	1
I	1
started	1
having	1
second	1
thoughts.	1
0	1
About	1
half	1
way	1
through	1
this	1
film	1
I	1
started	1
to	1
dislike	1
it.	1
0	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
film	1
ended,	1
I	1
not	1
only	1
disliked	1
it,	1
I	1
despised	1
it.	1
0	1
What	1
this	1
film	1
lacks	1
is	1
a	1
convincing	1
script.	1
0	1
The	1
script	1
looks	1
as	1
if	1
only	1
a	1
rough	1
draft	1
was	1
written	1
and	1
shooting	1
began	1
before	1
a	1
finished	1
script	1
was	1
completed.	1
0	1
Things	1
happen,	1
characters	1
personalities	1
change,	1
plot	1
twists	1
occur	1
for	1
no	1
real	1
reason	1
other	1
than	1
that	1
script	1
calls	1
for	1
it.	1
0	1
The	1
cast	1
is	1
good.	1
1	1
For	1
that,	1
it's	1
worth	1
checking	1
out.	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
probably	1
the	1
most	1
irritating	1
show	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
seen	1
in	1
my	1
entire	1
life.	1
0	1
It	1
is	1
indescribably	1
the	1
most	1
annoying	1
and	1
idiotic	1
show	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
seen.	1
0	1
Everything	1
about	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
bad.	1
0	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
understand,	1
what	1
kind	1
of	1
idiot	1
would	1
produce	1
this	1
mess	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
not	1
to	1
mention	1
several	1
season.	1
0	1
The	1
script	1
is	1
bad,	1
very	1
bad	1
	1
it	1
contains	1
both	1
cheesiness	1
and	1
unethical	1
joke	1
that	1
you	1
normally	1
see	1
in	1
rated	1
R	1
or	1
NC-17	1
movie.	1
0	1
The	1
casting	1
is	1

1	1
This	1
second	1
appearance	1
of	1
Mickey	1
Mouse	1
(following	1
the	1
silent	1
PLANE	1
CRAZY	1
earlier	1
that	1
year)	1
is	1
probably	1
his	1
most	1
famous	1
film--mostly	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
ground-breaking.	1
1	1
While	1
you	1
don't	1
yet	1
hear	1
Mickey	1
speak,	1
there	1
are	1
tons	1
of	1
sound	1
effects	1
and	1
music	1
throughout	1
the	1
film--something	1
we	1
take	1
for	1
granted	1
now	1
but	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
huge	1
crowd	1
pleaser	1
in	1
1928.	1
1	1
However,	1
after	1
seeing	1
the	1
short	1
again	1
after	1
about	1
25	1
years,	1
I	1
was	1
amazed	1
at	1
how	1
timeless	1
the	1
film	1
actually	1
is.	1
1	1
It's	1
just	1
adorable	1
seeing	1
Mickey	1
playing	1
"Turkey	1
in	1
the	1
Straw"	1
in	1
a	1
highly	1
imaginative	1
(if	1
occasionally	1
cruel)	1
way.	1
1	1
Clever	1
and	1
a	1
real	1
crowd-pleaser--this	1
film	1
still	1
ranks	1
among	1
Mickey's	1
best	1
films	1
even	1
after	1
80	1
wonderful	1
years.	1
1	1
The	1
bipolarity	1
of	1
the	1
ruthless	1
thug	1
(one	1
minute	1
a	1
ruthless	1
killer,	1
the	1
next	1
minute	1
a	1
Luv's	1
diaper	1
commercial)	1
is	1
completely	1
unconvincing.	1
0	1
I'm	1
terribly	1
disappointed	1
that	1
this	1
film	1
would	1
receive	1
so	1
many	1
awards	1
and	1
accolades,	1
especially	1
when	1
there	1
are	1
far	1
more	1
deserving	1

very,	1

bad	1
idea	1

It's	1
a	1
shame	1
to	1

good	1
actors	1

make	1
a	1
living	1
in	1
a	1
mess	1

this.	1

I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
bad.	1

Both	1
films	1
are	1
terrible,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
the	1
1986	1
version,	1
it	1
was	1
watchable.	1
0	1
Let's	1
start	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
problemsthe	1
acting,	1
especially	1
from	1
the	1
lead	1
professor,	1
was	1
very,	1
very	1
bad.	1
0	1
The	1
script	1
is	1
a	1
big	1
flawed	1
mess.	1
0	1
The	1
best	1
example	1
of	1
how	1
dumb	1
the	1
writing	1
is	1
when	1
it's	1
established	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
turn	1
the	1
zombie-students	1
back	1
into	1
humans	1
by	1
removing	1
a	1
necklace	1

The	1

Okay,	1
I	1
like	1
to	1
consider	1
myself	1
a	1
fair	1
critic,	1
so	1
I'll	1
give	1
credit	1
where	1
credit's	1
due--the	1
creature	1
effects	1
were	1
actually	1
pretty	1
cool.	1
1	1
Gotta	1
love	1
those	1
close-ups	1
of	1
slimy,	1
drooling	1
teeth!	1
1	1
To	1
sum	1
the	1
film	1
up,	1
"Breeders"	1
is	1
a	1
terrible,	1
cheaply	1
made	1
horror	1
movie	1
that	1
should	1
be	1
avoided	1
like	1
the	1
Ebola	1

Not	1
recommended.	1

He	1
is	1
almost	1
unbearable	1

Aside	1
from	1
it's	1

of	1

debits.	1

I	1
understand	1
that	1
it's	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
cheap	1
popcorn	1
comedy,	1
but	1
that	1
doesn't	1
mean	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
to	1
completely	1
insult	1
our	1
intelligence,	1
and	1
have	1
writing	1
so	1
incredibly	1
hackneyed	1
that	1
it	1
borders	1
on	1
offensive.	1

Lewis	1
Black's	1
considerable	1
talent	1
is	1
wasted	1
here	1
too,	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
his	1
most	1
incendiary	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
unrestrained,	1
which	1
the	1
PG-13	1
rating	1
certainly	1
won't	1
allow.	1

The	1
film's	1
sole	1

unrecognizable	1

to	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
weight	1
he	1
lost	1

1	1
With	1
the	1
originality	1

freshness	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
movie	1
now	1
spent,	1
this	1
remake	1
had	1
little	1
else	1
to	1
offer.	1
0	1
The	1
budget	1
was	1
evidently	1
very	1
limited.	1
0	1
This	1
was	1
reflected	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
cast,	1

also	1
in	1
the	1
below-par	1
script,	1
which	1
borrowed	1
much	1
from	1
the	1
earlier	1
classic.	1

However,	1
here	1
there	1

action	1

location	1
work	1

up.	1

review!	1
0	1
Being	1
a	1
90's	1
child,	1
I	1
truly	1
enjoyed	1
this	1
show	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
proudly	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
enjoyed	1
it	1
big	1
time	1
and	1
even	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
classical	1
WB	1
cartoons.	1
1	1
But	1
"Tiny	1
Toons"	1
kept	1
the	1
90's	1
vibe	1
and	1
delivered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
popular,	1
funny,	1
and	1
underrated	1
cartoons	1
ever	1
created.	1
1	1
The	1
memories	1
are	1
murky	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
enjoyed	1
every	1
single	1
episode	1
and	1
product	1
related	1
to	1
the	1
show.	1
1	1
Easily,	1
none	1
other	1
cartoon	1
made	1
me	1
laugh	1
in	1
a	1
tender	1
way	1
(before	1
getting	1
into	1
dark	1
sitcoms	1
oriented	1
for	1
teenagers).	1
1	1
The	1
characters	1
were	1
all	1
funny	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
not	1
having	1
a	1
true	1
lead	1
character.	1
1	1
Every	1
single	1
character	1
was	1
hilarious	1
and	1
deserved	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
lead.	1
1	1
Every	1
element	1
of	1
this	1
story	1
was	1
so	1
over	1
the	1
top,	1
excessively	1
phony	1
and	1
contrived	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
painful	1
to	1
sit	1
through.	1

Her	1
lines	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1

fifteen	1
year	1
old,	1
though	1
they	1
are	1
trying	1
oh	1
so,	1
so	1
hard	1
to	1
sound	1
like	1
how	1
a	1
fifteen	1
year	1
old	1
would	1
really,	1
um,	1
you	1
know,	1
well...	1
talk.	1
0	1
Perabo	1
has	1
a	1
nice	1
energy	1
level	1

is	1
obviously	1
very	1
comfortable	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
camera.	1
1	1
There	1
is	1
simply	1
no	1
excuse	1
for	1
something	1
this	1
poorly	1
done.	1
0	1
I	1
saw	1
this	1
movie	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
stupid	1
movie.	1
0	1
What	1
is	1
even	1
more	1
stupid	1
is	1
that	1
who	1
had	1
thought	1
an	1
idea	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
volcano	1
in	1
Los	1
Angeles?	1
0	1
To	1
be	1
honest	1
with	1
you,	1
this	1
is	1
unbelievable	1
nonsense	1
and	1
very	1
foolish.	1
0	1
In	1
conclusion,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
bother	1
with	1
this	1
movie	1
because	1
a	1
volcano	1
in	1
Los	1
Angeles	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
nonsense.	1

The	1
story	1
line	1
is	1
just	1
awful!	1

It's	1
just	1
painful!	1

And	1
the	1
accents	1
are	1

abysmal!	1

There's	1
also	1
enough	1

in	1
this	1

believe	1
that	1
Pitch	1
Black	1
was	1
done	1
well.	1
1	1
The	1

and	1
you	1

to	1
find	1
out	1
more	1
about	1
them	1
the	1
longer	1
the	1
movie	1
goes	1
on,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
people	1
will	1
be	1
surprised	1
by	1
who	1
does	1
and	1
doesn't	1

it.	1

The	1
characters	1
are	1
interesting	1
and	1
you	1
really	1
care	1
for	1
them.	1
1	1
An	1
instant	1
classic,	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
soundtrack	1
and	1
a	1
catchy	1
song	1
during	1
the	1
ending	1
credits.	1
1	1
Don't	1
miss	1
it.	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
masterful	1
piece	1
of	1
film-making,	1
with	1
many	1
themes	1
simmering	1
and	1
occasionally	1
boiling	1
over	1
in	1
this	1
warts	1
and	1
all	1
study	1
of	1
the	1
poet's	1
bohemian,	1
self-indulgent	1
wartime	1
years	1
that	1
span	1
the	1
aerial	1
bombardments	1
of	1
London	1
and	1
the	1
outward	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
a	1
Welsh	1
coastal	1
retreat	1
-	1
the	1
borderlines	1
between	1
friendship,	1
lust	1
and	1
love,	1
dedication	1
to	1
art	1
and	1
experience	1
versus	1
practical	1
concerns,	1
jealousy,	1
rivalry,	1
cowardice	1
and	1
egotism	1
versus	1
heroism	1
and	1
self-sacrifice	1
and	1
more.	1
1	1
A	1
mature,	1
subtle	1
script	1
that	1
suggests	1
and	1
occasionally	1
brings	1
into	1
dramatic	1
focus	1
the	1
underlying	1
tensions	1
is	1
well	1
served	1
by	1
perfect	1
performances	1
(apart	1
from	1
the	1
odd	1
inappropriate	1
smiling	1
that	1
Keira	1
Knightley	1
is	1
prone	1
to,	1
though	1
perhaps	1
under	1
direction	1
this	1
time	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
characters	1
themselves	1
often	1
mention	1
it).	1
1	1
But	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
exquisite	1
visual	1
composition	1
of	1
each	1
moment,	1
with	1
inventive	1
and	1
elegant	1
use	1
of	1
close-up,	1
camera	1
angle	1
and	1
lighting,	1
including	1
pointillistic	1
faux	1
home	1
movie	1
footage,	1
is	1
a	1
wonder	1
and	1
joy	1
to	1
behold.	1
1	1
It's	1
as	1
continuously	1
beautiful	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
as	1
a	1
Bertolucci,	1
but	1
the	1
relationships	1
here	1
are	1
more	1
convincing	1
and	1
the	1
narrative	1
more	1
engaging	1
than	1
some	1
of	1
that	1
master's	1
work.	1
1	1
The	1
basic	1
premise	1
is	1
wasted	1
since	1
it	1
is	1
sidelined	1
by	1
the	1
inexplicable	1
focus	1
on	1
the	1
documentary	1
crew.	1
0	1
Regardless,	1
the	1
film	1
fails	1
on	1
most	1
levels.	1

Avoid	1
at	1
all	1
costs.	1

I	1
saw	1
this	1
film	1
over	1
Christmas,	1
and	1
what	1
a	1
great	1
film	1
it	1
was!	1
1	1
I	1
thought	1
Errol	1
Flynn	1
was	1
brilliant	1
as	1
Custer	1
and	1
has	1
since	1
become	1
my	1
favourite	1
actor!	1
1	1
His	1
acting	1
alongside	1
Olivia	1
De	1
Havilland	1
was	1
brilliant	1
and	1
the	1
ending	1
was	1
fantastic!	1
1	1
I	1
had	1
always	1
known	1
that	1
Errol	1
Flynn	1
was	1
a	1
brilliant	1
actor	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
my	1
dads	1
favourite	1
actor,	1
and	1
I	1
grew	1
up	1
watching	1
his	1
films	1
as	1
a	1
child.	1
1	1
But	1
it	1
wasn't	1
until	1
I	1
watched	1
this	1
film	1
that	1
I	1
realised	1
how	1
great	1
he	1
actually	1
was.	1
1	1
I'll	1
give	1
this	1
film	1
10	1
out	1
of	1
10!	1
1	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
Jim	1
O'Connor	1
was	1
very	1
energetic	1
and	1
that	1
nobody	1
could	1
be	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
him,	1
but	1
George	1
was	1
well	1
dull.	1
0	1
He	1
really	1
didn't	1
seem	1
to	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
hosting;	1
his	1
voice-overs	1
were	1
monotonous,	1
didn't	1
get	1
involved	1
with	1
the	1
guests.	1

Lovely	1
little	1
thriller	1
from	1
Hitchcock,	1
with	1
lots	1
of	1
nice	1
shenanigans	1
surrounding	1
a	1
murdered	1
spy,	1
a	1
kidnapped	1
child,	1
a	1
nasty	1
church,	1
a	1
foreign	1
plot	1
and	1
some	1
random	1
taxidermists.	1
1	1
Jimmy	1
Stewart	1
is	1
as	1
ever	1
a	1
great	1
hero	1
for	1
Hitchcock,	1
the	1
story	1
rips	1
along	1
to	1
its	1
cool	1
climax	1
at	1
an	1
embassy	1
function,	1
but	1
it	1
lacks	1
the	1
brooding	1
menace	1
of	1
Hitchcock's	1
black	1
and	1
white,	1
low-budget	1
original.	1
1	1
Nevertheless	1
yet	1
another	1
wonderful	1
film	1
from	1
the	1
great	1
master's	1
stable.	1
1	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
film	1
was	1
excellently	1
produced	1
and	1
tops	1
the	1
ratings	1
as	1
a	1
typical	1
sci	1
fi	1
film!	1
1	1
Excellently	1
produced	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
Sci-fi's	1
best	1
producers	1
Scot	1
Vandiver	1
!	1
1	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
entertaining,	1
nonetheless.	1
1	1
It's	1
a	1
campy	1
sort	1
of	1
film	1
that's	1
a	1
joy	1
to	1
watch.	1
1	1
There's	1
barely	1
a	1
boring	1
moment	1
in	1
the	1
film	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
plenty	1
of	1
humorous	1
parts.	1
1	1
The	1
cast	1
is	1
always	1
entertaining	1
as	1
usual.	1
1	1
Overall,	1
a	1
delight!	1
1	1
This	1
movie	1
is	1
so	1
mind-bendingly	1
awful,	1
it	1
couldn't	1
have	1
even	1
been	1
created.	1

revealing	1

of	1
the	1
task	1
and	1
the	1
incredible	1
challenges	1
facing	1
South	1
Africa.	1
1	1
I	1
believe	1
every	1
one	1
should	1
see	1
this	1
movie	1
as	1
I	1
think	1
few	1
people	1
outside	1
of	1
South	1
Africa	1
understand	1
its	1
past	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
being	1
attempted	1
in	1
the	1
Truth	1
and	1
Reconciliation	1
process.	1
1	1
Nothing	1
short	1
of	1
magnificent	1
photography/cinematography	1
in	1
this	1
film.	1
1	1
The	1
acting	1
is	1
fantastic,	1
the	1
stories	1
are	1

are	1

Don't	1

10/10	1
1	1
Excellent	1
performance.	1
1	1
There	1
still	1
are	1
good	1

around!	1
1	1
Also	1
great	1
directing	1

1	1
Very	1
true	1

Shakespear,	1

a	1
'must'	1
for	1
all	1
Shakespear	1
fans.	1
1	1
Macbeth	1
(Jason	1
Connery)	1
moved	1
me	1
to	1
tears	1
with	1
his	1
final	1
monolog	1
(out	1
brief	1
candle,	1
out)He	1
gave	1
the	1
sphere	1
of	1
moral	1
decay	1
and	1
dark	1
forces	1
a	1
human	1
face,	1
which	1
makes	1
it	1
the	1
more	1
interesting.	1
1	1
Helen	1
Baxendale	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
credible	1
lady	1
Macbeth	1
who	1
can	1
be	1
very	1
cheerfull	1
at	1
times	1
and	1
sometimes	1
she	1
just	1
looks	1
like	1
a	1
naughty	1
girl,	1
but	1
deadly	1
in	1
her	1
taste	1
for	1
blood	1
and	1
evil.	1
1	1
If	1
you	1
love	1
death	1
and	1
decay,	1
and	1
Shakespears	1
lyrics...	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
one.	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
witty	1
and	1
delightful	1
adaptation	1
of	1
the	1
Dr	1
Seuss	1
book,	1
brilliantly	1
animated	1
by	1
UPA's	1
finest	1
and	1
thoroughly	1
deserving	1
of	1
its	1
Academy	1
Award.	1
1	1
Special	1
mention	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
superb	1
music	1
score	1
and	1
sound	1
effects,	1
which	1
are	1
an	1
integral	1
element	1
in	1
helping	1
to	1
make	1
this	1
such	1
a	1
memorable	1
and	1
enjoyable	1
cartoon.	1
1	1
However	1
Paul	1
Schrader	1
has	1
indeed	1
made	1
a	1
film	1
"about"	1
Mishima	1
that	1
is	1
both	1
superb	1
&	1
complex.	1
1	1
Also	1
notable	1
is	1
John	1
Bailey's	1
fine	1
crisp	1
beautifully	1
colored	1
cinematography	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
production	1
design	1
&	1
costumes	1
by	1
Eiko	1
Ishioka	1
who	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
memorable	1
costumes	1
for	1
Coppola's	1
Dracula	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
received	1
a	1
well	1
deserved	1
Oscar.	1
1	1
Even	1
allowing	1
for	1
poor	1
production	1
values	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
(1971)	1
and	1
the	1
format	1
(some	1
kind	1
of	1
mini-series),	1
this	1
is	1
baaaaaad.	1

theatrical	1
feeling	1

actually	1
gets	1
from	1
watching	1

the	1
right	1

I	1
just	1
saw	1
this	1
film	1
and	1
I	1
recommend	1
it.	1
1	1
It	1
has	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
plot,	1
it	1
holds	1
your	1
complete	1
attention,	1
the	1
acting	1
is	1
superb,	1
Tom	1
Wilkinson	1
was	1
fantastic	1
and	1
Emily	1
Watson	1
was	1
also	1
very	1
good.	1
1	1
A	1
very	1
good	1
film	1
indeed,	1
about	1
great	1
and	1
unconditional	1
love.	1
1	1
Tom	1
Wilkinson's	1
character	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
ordeal	1
that	1
is	1
about	1
to	1
begin,	1
but	1
he	1
takes	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
hand	1
as	1
the	1
story	1
progresses,	1
and	1
this	1
great	1
actor	1
gives	1
a	1
performance	1
that	1
makes	1
you	1
feel	1
the	1
character's	1
anguish	1
and	1
suffering.	1
1	1
Emily	1
Watson's	1
character	1
is	1
very	1
strong,	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
only	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
quick	1
glance	1
and	1
you	1
understand	1
everything.	1
1	1
Despite	1
the	1
pans	1
of	1
reviewers,	1
I	1
liked	1
this	1
movie.	1
1	1
In	1
fact,	1
I	1
liked	1
it	1
better	1
than	1
Interview	1
With	1
a	1
Vampire	1
and	1
I	1
liked	1
this	1
Lestat	1
(Stuart	1
Townsend)	1
better	1
than	1
Cruise's	1
attempt.	1
1	1
Aailiyah	1
was	1
pretty	1
good	1
as	1
Akasha,	1
in	1
places	1
compelling	1
(her	1
first	1
entrance	1
and	1
mini	1
dance	1
scene).	1
1	1
I'm	1
a	1
big	1
fan	1
of	1
this	1
series	1
mostly	1
due	1
to	1
Anne	1
Rice's	1
style,	1
sensitivities	1
and	1
treatments.	1
1	1
I	1
guess	1
I	1
liked	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
dysfunction--he	1
was	1
believable.	1
1	1
The	1
football	1
scenes	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
were	1
perplexing.	1
0	1
But	1
I	1
thought	1
his	1
acting	1
was	1
skilled.	1
1	1
Meredith	1
M	1
was	1
better	1
than	1
all	1
right.	1
1	1
A	1
very	1
charming	1
film	1
with	1
wonderful	1
sentiment	1
and	1
heart.	1
1	1
It	1
is	1
rare	1
when	1
a	1
film-maker	1
takes	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
worthy	1
moral	1
tale	1
with	1
care	1
and	1
love	1
that	1
doesn't	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
trap	1
of	1
being	1
overly	1
syrupy	1
or	1
over	1
indulgent.	1
1	1
Nine	1
out	1
of	1
ten	1
for	1
a	1
truly	1
lovely	1
film.	1
1	1
This	1
early	1
film	1
from	1
future	1
goremeister	1
Lucio	1
Fulci	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
giallo	1
sub-genre.	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
Italian	1
thrillers	1
of	1
the	1
early	1
70's.	1
1	1
A	1
standout	1
scene.	1
1	1
This	1
scene	1
is	1
very	1
strong	1
and	1
unpleasant.	1
0	1
Technically,	1
the	1
film	1
is	1
well	1
made	1
with	1
impressive	1
camera-work,	1
solid	1
acting	1
and	1
effective	1
music	1
from	1
Riz	1
Ortolani	1
	1
particularly	1
good	1
is	1
a	1
recurring	1
unaccompanied	1
female	1
vocal	1
that	1
sounds	1
like	1
it's	1
coming	1
from	1
a	1
distant	1
hill.	1
1	1
It's	1
still	1
wild	1
stuff	1
though	1
and	1
is	1
highly	1
recommended	1
to	1
fans	1
of	1
giallo	1
cinema.	1
1	1
The	1
movie	1
was	1
very	1
interesting	1
from	1
beginning	1
to	1
the	1
end.	1
1	1
I	1
liked	1
the	1
way	1
Dustin	1
Hoffman's	1
character	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
do	1
just	1
about	1
everything	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
his	1
son.	1
1	1
This	1
movie	1
is	1
also	1
revealing.	1
1	1
Personally,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
shows	1
that	1
people	1
should	1
learn	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
compromise	1
them	1
self	1
without	1
involving	1
other	1
people	1
into	1
issue.	1
1	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
boring.	1
0	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
tired	1
of	1
clichés	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
lazy	1
writing,	1
and	1
here	1
they	1
come	1
in	1
thick	1
and	1
fast.	1
0	1
PS	1
the	1
only	1
scene	1
in	1
the	1
movie	1
that	1
was	1
cool	1
is	1
when	1
the	1
central	1
character	1
finds	1
her	1
room	1
blown	1
up.	1
1	1
It's	1
a	1
fresh,	1
subtle,	1
and	1
rather	1
sublime	1
effect.	1
1	1
An	1
Italian	1
reviewer	1
called	1
this	1
"a	1
small,	1
great	1
film,"	1
and	1
that's	1
right.	1
1	1
All	1
the	1
actors	1
give	1
a	1
wonderful	1
performance,	1
especially	1
Jennifer	1
Rubin	1
as	1
Jamie	1
Harris,	1
who	1
changes	1
from	1
the	1
nervous	1
starlet	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
through	1
the	1
strange	1
events	1
she	1
is	1
part	1
of	1
to	1
the	1
cool	1
star.	1
1	1
You	1
learn	1
a	1
lot	1
about	1
the	1
real	1
inside	1
emotions	1
of	1
people	1
in	1
this	1
movie,	1
and	1
a	1
lot	1
about	1
the	1
movie	1
business	1
itself.	1
1	1
The	1
movie	1
in	1
movie	1
situations	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
game	1
that	1
is	1
played	1
with	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
"acting	1
coach"	1
are	1
fascinating.	1
1	1
Also	1
the	1
music	1
by	1
Mark	1
Snow	1
is	1
possibly	1
the	1
best	1
score	1
I've	1
ever	1
heard.	1
1	1

any	1

The	1
Foreigner	1
is	1
not	1
worth	1
one	1
second	1
of	1
your	1
time.	1
0	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
child	1
on	1
TV	1
back	1
in	1
1973,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
"The	1
Stranger"	1
and	1
I	1
loved	1
it.	1
1	1
But	1
the	1
duet	1
between	1
the	1
astronaut	1
and	1
his	1
doctor	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
movie	1
is	1
a	1
perfect	1
exchange	1
if	1
one	1
considers	1
that	1
this	1
movie	1
was	1
made	1
well	1
into	1
the	1
Cold	1
War	1
and	1
the	1
astronaut's	1
biggest	1
fear	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
crashed	1
in	1
the	1
USSR.	1
1	1
This	1
movie	1
is	1
so	1
awesome!	1
1	1
I	1
loved	1
it,	1
it	1
was	1
really	1
scary.	1
1	1
I	1
love	1
the	1
Scream	1
movies	1
and	1
all	1
horror	1
movies	1
and	1
this	1
one	1
ranks	1
way	1
up	1
there.	1
1	1
If	1
you	1
want	1
a	1
real	1
scare	1
rent	1
this	1
one!	1
1	1
10/10	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
film.	1
1	1
As	1
a	1
courtroom	1
drama,	1
it's	1
compelling,	1
as	1
an	1
indictment	1
on	1
the	1
American	1
justice	1
system,	1
it's	1
frightening.	1
1	1
This	1
film	1
highlights	1
the	1
fundamental	1
flaws	1
of	1
the	1
legal	1
process,	1
that	1
it's	1
not	1
about	1
discovering	1
guilt	1
or	1
innocence,	1
but	1
rather,	1
is	1
about	1
who	1
presents	1
better	1
in	1
court.	1
1	1
The	1
film	1
is	1
well	1
paced,	1
understated	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
courtroom	1
documentaries	1
I've	1
seen.	1
1	1
This	1
mostly	1
routine	1
fact-based	1
TV	1
drama	1
gets	1
a	1
boost	1
from	1
the	1
fine	1
performance	1
by	1
Cole.	1
1	1
Predictable,	1
but	1
not	1
a	1
bad	1
watch.	1
1	1
It	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
range	1
and	1
ability	1
to	1
pull	1
off	1
this	1
part.	1
1	1
She	1
carries	1
the	1
movie	1
well.	1
1	1
Constantine	1
gives	1
everything	1
the	1
right	1
intensity	1
and	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
underlying	1
psychological	1
motivations.	1
1	1
It	1
is	1
wonderful	1
and	1
inspiring	1
to	1
watch,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
it	1
gets	1
released	1
again	1
on	1
to	1
video	1
or	1
DVD.	1
1	1
How	1
this	1
piece	1
of	1
trash	1
was	1
ever	1
released	1
is	1
beyond	1
me:	1
the	1
acting,	1
the	1
story,	1
the	1
characters,	1
the	1
supposedly	1
special	1
effects,	1
etc...it's	1
ALL	1
wrong.	1
0	1
In	1
fact,	1
this	1
stinker	1
smells	1
like	1
a	1

release.	1

from	1
all	1
involved	1
and	1
that	1
includes	1
those	1
like	1
Shatner	1

bad	1

out	1

attempts	1

were	1
pitiful	1

is	1
so	1
awful	1

just	1
didn't	1

Editing:	1
The	1
editing	1
of	1
this	1
film	1
was	1
phenomenal	1
in	1
my	1
opinion.	1
1	1
When	1
a	1
song	1
could	1
explain	1
the	1
emotions	1
of	1
the	1
subjects	1
better,	1
such	1
as	1
when	1
Jay	1
Adams'	1
unfortunate	1
life	1
was	1
a	1
subject	1
of	1
talk,	1
the	1
song	1
Old	1
Man	1
by	1
Neil	1
Young	1
was	1
played,	1
which	1
evokes	1
many	1
emotions.	1
1	1
Cinematography:	1
The	1
film	1
was	1
shot	1
in	1
an	1
interesting	1
way.	1
1	1
Of	1
course	1
the	1
footage	1
from	1
the	1
70s	1
was	1
grainy,	1
but	1
that	1
only	1
enhanced	1

This	1
film	1
offers	1
many	1
delights	1
and	1
surprises.	1
1	1
When	1
Achille	1
and	1
Philippa	1
beautifully	1
sing	1
a	1
duet	1
from	1
"Don	1
Giovanni"	1
that	1
perfectly	1
describes	1
their	1
situation	1
in	1
the	1
movie,	1
you	1
appreciate	1
the	1
subtle	1
layers	1
of	1
this	1
excellent	1
film.	1
1	1
The	1
story	1
unfolds	1
in	1
18th	1
century	1
Jutland	1
and	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
period	1
music	1
played	1
on	1
period	1
instruments	1
is	1
just	1
one	1
more	1
fine	1
touch.	1
1	1
You	1
share	1
General	1
Loewenhielm's	1
exquisite	1
joy	1
in	1
his	1
partaking	1
of	1
the	1
Cailles	1
en	1
Sarcophage	1
even	1
though	1
you	1
are	1
just	1
watching	1
a	1
movie	1
-	1
but	1
you	1
do	1
wish	1
for	1
just	1
a	1
small	1
sample	1
to	1
savor.	1
1	1
But	1
this	1
understated	1
film	1
leaves	1
a	1
lasting	1
impression.	1
1	1
The	1
warmth	1
it	1
generates	1
is	1
in	1
contrast	1
to	1
its	1
austere	1
backdrop.	1
1	1
You	1
will	1
leave	1
the	1
theater	1
wanting	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
and	1
dance	1
under	1
the	1
stars.	1
1	1
The	1
acting,	1
as	1
you'd	1
expect	1
from	1
this	1
cast,	1
is	1
top	1
notch.	1
1	1
The	1
characters	1
are	1
fleshed	1
out	1
surprisingly	1
well,	1
particularly	1
Grimes	1
and	1
Blake,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
actors	1
deliver	1
their	1
sharply	1
scripted	1
lines	1
with	1
just	1
the	1
right	1
amount	1
of	1
deadpan	1
tongue	1
in	1
cheek	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
dialogue	1
both	1
hilarious	1
and	1
realistic.	1
1	1
Angus	1
Scrimm	1
also	1
turns	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
performance	1
in	1
a	1
somewhat	1
brief	1
but	1
memorable	1
role	1
as	1
the	1
gently	1
menacing,	1
violin-playing	1
anatomist	1
Doctor	1
Quinn.	1
1	1
Conclusion	1
-	1
I	1
loved	1
it.	1
1	1
It's	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
since	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
entertained	1
by	1
a	1
movie.	1
1	1
I	1
struggle	1
to	1
find	1
anything	1
bad	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
it.	1
1	1
Mark	1
my	1
words,	1
this	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
cult	1
films	1
like	1
Evil	1
Dead	1
2	1
or	1
Phantasm	1
that	1
people	1
will	1
still	1
be	1
discovering	1
and	1
falling	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
20,	1
30,	1
40	1
years	1
down	1
the	1
line.	1
1	1
It's	1
pretty	1
surprising	1
that	1
this	1
wonderful	1
film	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
1949,	1
as	1
Hollywood	1
generally	1
had	1
its	1
collective	1
heads	1
in	1
the	1
sand	1
concerning	1
black	1
and	1
white	1
issues	1
at	1
that	1
time.	1
1	1
The	1
film	1
deserves	1
strong	1
kudos	1
for	1
taking	1
this	1
stand,	1
for	1
having	1
exceptional	1
acting	1
from	1
its	1
mostly	1
lesser-known	1
cast	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
super-intelligent	1
script	1
that	1
doesn't	1
insult	1
the	1
audience	1
or	1
take	1
the	1
easy	1
way	1
out	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
white	1
racism.	1
1	1
Plus,	1
with	1
the	1
movie's	1
rather	1
modest	1
budget	1
and	1
fast	1
running	1
time,	1
it	1
does	1
an	1
amazing	1
job!	1

Juano	1

exceptional	1
actor	1
who	1
played	1
supporting	1
roles	1
in	1

era)	1

evinced	1

imagine	1
that	1

sub-plot	1
thrown	1
in	1
that	1
follows	1

don't	1

with	1

won't	1

it,	1

the	1

best	1
scene	1

I	1
won't	1

If	1
there	1
was	1
ever	1
an	1
indication	1
of	1
a	1
writer	1
and	1
a	1
director's	1
ability	1
to	1
meld	1
two	1
highly	1
volatile	1
temperaments	1
into	1
a	1
seamless	1
union	1
of	1
creativity,	1
then	1
this	1
is	1
it!	1
1	1
The	1
result	1
is	1
a	1
powerhouse	1
achievement,	1
made	1
more	1
timely	1
now	1
perhaps	1
because	1
of	1
our	1
culture's	1
disturbing	1
fascination	1
with	1
celebrity,	1
and	1
it's	1
distorted	1
interpretations	1
of	1
fame.	1
1	1
A	1
film	1
not	1
easily	1
forgotten.	1
1	1
But,	1
Kevin	1
Spacey	1
is	1
an	1
excellent,	1
verbal	1
tsunami	1
as	1
Buddy	1
Ackerman	1
	1
and	1
totally	1
believable	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
actor.	1
1	1
The	1
scripting	1
of	1
the	1
subtle	1
comedy	1
is	1
unmatched	1
by	1
any	1
movie	1
in	1
recent	1
years.	1
1	1
The	1
characters	1
are	1
interesting,	1
even	1
if	1
a	1
bit	1
predictable.	1
1	1
Highly	1
recommended	1
for	1
all	1
ages,	1
although	1
the	1
younger	1
set	1
will	1
probably	1
not	1
appreciate	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
subtle	1
references,	1
they	1
will	1
certainly	1
appreciate	1
one	1
galley	1
scene	1

particular!	1

one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
boring	1
Horror	1
movies	1
from	1
the	1
90's	1
mainly	1
because	1
it	1
starts	1
slow	1
and	1
centers	1
in	1
a	1
boring	1
atmosphere.	1

The	1
puppets	1
look	1
really	1
cheesy	1

not	1

story	1

lame,	1

this	1

a	1
wonderful,	1
heartwarming	1
tale	1
about	1
two	1
people	1
chasing	1
their	1
dreams.	1
1	1
The	1
best	1
part	1
about	1
"Nurse	1
Betty"	1
is	1
it's	1
unpredictability.	1
1	1
Director	1
Neil	1
LaBute	1
uses	1
brutal	1
violence	1
to	1
seperate	1
dreams	1
from	1
reality,	1
and	1
along	1
with	1
the	1
touching	1
drama,	1
and	1
hilarious	1
comedy,	1
you	1
can	1
never	1
tell	1
what	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
happen	1
next.	1
1	1
Otherwise,	1
don't	1
even	1
waste	1
your	1
time	1
on	1
this.	1
0	1
This	1
one	1
just	1
fails	1
to	1
create	1
any	1
real	1
suspense.	1

As	1
for	1
the	1
killer,	1
don't	1
expect	1
anything	1
original	1

even	1
remotely	1
frightening.	1

There	1
is,	1
however,	1
some	1
pretty	1
good	1
acting	1
(at	1

this	1
type	1
of	1
film).	1
1	1
I'm	1
so	1
sorry	1

to	1
anyone.	1
0	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
boring,pointless	1
movies	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
seen.	1
0	1
The	1
secondary	1
plot	1
line	1
is	1
incomprehensible	1
and	1
its	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
primary	1
plot	1
line	1
is	1
mystifying.	1
0	1
Hated	1
it.	1
0	1
This	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
worst	1
Sandra	1
Bullock	1
movie	1
since	1
Speed	1
2	1
But	1
not	1
quite	1
that	1
bad.	1
0	1
I	1
don't	1
understand	1
how	1
this	1
garbage	1
got	1
on	1
the	1
shelves	1
of	1
the	1
movie	1
store,	1
it's	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
real	1
movie!	1
0	1
I	1
highly	1
doubt	1
that	1
anyone	1
could	1
ever	1
like	1
this	1
trash.	1
0	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
movie-making.	1
0	1
The	1
acting	1
is	1
like	1
watching	1
wooden	1
puppets	1
moving	1
around	1
and	1
reading	1
from	1
a	1
book,	1
that's	1
how	1
bad	1
it	1
is.	1
0	1
So	1
I	1
am	1
here	1
to	1
warn	1
you--DO	1
NOT	1
RENT	1
THIS	1
MOVIE,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
dumbest	1
thing	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
seen!	1

I	1
saw	1
this	1
short	1
film	1
on	1
HBO	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
and	1
absolutely	1
loved	1
it.	1
1	1
I	1
didn't	1
realize	1
how	1
wonderful	1
the	1
short	1
really	1
is	1
until	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
scenes.	1
1	1
Excellent	1
short	1
film.	1
1	1
Hopefully,	1
the	1
director	1
James	1
Cox	1
can	1
turn	1
the	1
short	1
into	1
a	1
feature	1
length	1
film	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
cast,	1
or	1
win	1
us	1
over	1
with	1
a	1
whole	1
new	1
film.	1
1	1
I	1
agree	1
with	1
Jessica,	1
this	1
movie	1
is	1
pretty	1
bad.	1
0	1
Characters	1
are	1
one-dimensional,	1
even	1
the	1
good	1
guys	1
and	1
especially	1
the	1
bad	1
guys.	1
0	1
The	1
story	1
line	1
is	1
totally	1
predictable.	1
0	1
Not	1
much	1
dialogue,	1
not	1
much	1
music,	1
the	1
whole	1
film	1
was	1
shot	1
as	1
elaborately	1
and	1
aesthetically	1
like	1
a	1
sculpture.	1
1	1
I've	1
seen	1
soap	1
operas	1
more	1
intelligent	1
than	1
this	1
movie.	1
0	1
Bad	1
characters,	1
bad	1
story	1
and	1
bad	1
acting.	1
0	1
Really	1
awful.	1
0	1
Not	1
easy	1
to	1
watch.	1
0	1
Funny,	1
clever,	1
hip	1
-	1
just	1
like	1
Pray's	1
previous	1
film,	1
Hype!	1
1	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
that	1
i	1
didn't	1
see	1
a	1
so	1
charismatic	1
actor	1
on	1
screen.	1
1	1
Paolo	1
Sorrentino	1
has	1
written	1
a	1
wonderful	1
story	1
about	1
loneliness	1
and	1
Tony	1
has	1
built	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
unforgettable	1
characters	1
seen	1
in	1
movies	1
in	1
recent	1
years.	1
1	1
The	1
movie	1
is	1
not	1
completely	1
perfect	1
but	1
'Titta	1
Di	1
Girolamo'	1
will	1
stay	1
with	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
after	1
the	1
vision	1
of	1
the	1
movie.	1
1	1
I	1
rate	1
this	1
movie	1
9/10.	1
1	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
if	1
this	1
was	1
Emilio	1
Estevez's	1
directorial	1
debut,	1
but	1
the	1
pacing,	1
the	1
interplay	1
and	1
development	1
of	1
the	1
characters	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
some	1
clever	1
camera	1
work	1
surrounding	1
the	1
character	1
Estevez	1
plays	1
all	1
suggest	1
a	1
natural	1
eye.	1
1	1
The	1
interplay	1
between	1
Martin	1
and	1
Emilio	1
contains	1
the	1
same	1
wonderful	1
chemistry	1
we	1
saw	1
in	1
Wall	1
Street	1
with	1
Martin	1
and	1
Charlie.	1
1	1
Kathy	1
Bates	1
is	1
wonderful	1
in	1
her	1
characters	1
subtle	1
desperation	1
and	1
escapism;	1
a	1
variation	1
on	1
her	1
character	1
in	1
"At	1
Play	1
In	1
The	1
Fields	1
Of	1
The	1
Lord".	1
1	1
For	1
readers	1
who	1
have	1
already	1
seen	1
one	1
of	1
Miyazaki's	1
films:	1
he	1
is	1
still	1
in	1
top	1
form	1
and	1
made	1
another	1
worthwhile	1
experience.	1
1	1
It	1
never	1
condescends,	1
all	1
the	1
characters	1
have	1
good	1
genuine	1
hearts	1
and	1
believable	1
problems.	1
1	1
The	1
two	1
main	1
characters	1
may	1
be	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
believable	1
children	1
I	1
ever	1
saw	1
put	1
on	1
screen.	1
1	1
They	1
are	1
so	1
easy	1
to	1
love,	1
but	1
even	1
more	1
easy	1
to	1
identify	1
with.	1
1	1
This	1
movie	1
is	1
great--especially	1
if	1
you	1
enjoy	1
visual	1
arts.	1
1	1
The	1
scenery	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
daughters	1
paint	1
and	1
photograph	1
are	1
beautiful.	1
1	1
The	1
story	1
is	1
also	1
both	1
funny	1
and	1
poignant	1
at	1
times.	1
1	1
People	1
who	1
like	1
European	1
films	1
and	1
"art	1
movies"	1
will	1
like	1
this	1
movie.	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
truly	1
an	1
art	1
movie--it	1
actually	1
has	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
art	1
in	1
it.	1
1	1
Go	1
rent	1
it.	1
1	1
However,	1
after	1
finally	1
watching	1
this	1
film,	1
I	1
realized	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
had	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
closed	1
mind	1
to	1
the	1
brilliance	1
it	1
depicts,	1
I	1
also	1
found	1
myself	1
watching	1
it	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again.	1
1	1
It's	1
the	1
one	1
movie	1
that	1
never	1
ceases	1
to	1
interest	1
me,	1
simply	1
because	1
it	1
keeps	1
me	1
alert,	1
as	1
I	1
try	1
to	1
attempt	1
to	1
decipher	1
it's	1
meanings.	1
1	1
Brilliance	1
indeed.	1
1	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
liked	1
movies	1
like	1
The	1
Matrix	1
(and	1
better	1
yet,	1
their	1
sequels)	1
I	1
think	1
you'll	1
appreciate	1
the	1
thought	1
provoking,	1
mindblowing	1
experience	1
this	1
film	1
will	1
give	1
you.	1
1	1
Think	1
of	1
the	1
film	1
being	1
like	1
a	1
dream.	1
1	1
Simply	1
beautiful.	1
1	1
Both	1
Rickman	1
and	1
Stowe	1
play	1
their	1
roles	1
to	1
the	1
hilt	1
in	1
this	1
tale	1
of	1
a	1
childrens'	1
book	1
writer	1
who--	1
maybe?--	1
has	1
written	1
a	1
subversive	1
tract.	1
1	1
It's	1
a	1
gloriously	1
fun,	1
fast	1
paced	1
and	1
fairly	1
accurate	1
portrayal	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
a	1
raver.	1
1	1
It	1
presents	1
a	1
idyllic	1
yet	1
serious	1
portrayal	1
of	1
the	1
ups	1
and	1
downs	1
of	1
the	1
characters	1
lives.	1
1	1
Just	1
whatever	1
you	1
do,	1
avoid	1
"Groove"	1
as	1
its	1
the	1
antithesis	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
about	1
Human	1
Traffic.	1
0	1
It's	1
too	1
bad	1
that	1
everyone	1
else	1
involved	1
didn't	1
share	1
Crowe's	1
level	1
of	1
dedication	1
to	1
quality,	1
for	1
if	1
they	1
did,	1
we'd	1
have	1
a	1
far	1
better	1
film	1
on	1
our	1
hands	1
than	1
this	1
sub-par	1
mess.	1
0	1
The	1
movie	1
seemed	1
a	1
little	1
slow	1
at	1
first.	1
0	1
But	1
it	1
picked	1
up	1
speed	1
and	1
got	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
point.	1
1	1
It	1
showed	1
exactly	1
how	1
the	1
government	1
and	1
the	1
scientist	1
argued	1
for	1
humanity	1
and	1
the	1
reasons	1
of	1
the	1
"gadget".	1
1	1
I	1
enjoyed	1
it.	1
1	1
I	1
have	1
recommended	1
it	1
to	1
friends.	1
1	1
I	1
was	1
particularly	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
acting	1
ability	1
of	1
Dwight	1
Schultz.	1
1	1
Both	1
actors	1
truly	1
understand	1
and	1
become	1
their	1
particular	1
character,	1
delivering	1
a	1
convincing,	1
sincere	1
performance.	1
1	1
Their	1
on-screen	1
chemistry,	1
critical	1
to	1
the	1
entire	1
film,	1
is	1
genuine.	1
1	1
The	1
film's	1
dialogue	1
is	1
natural,	1
real	1
to	1
life.	1
1	1
The	1
writer,	1
Gorman	1
Bechard,	1
undoubtedly	1
did	1
his	1
homework	1
because	1
all	1
references	1
are	1
industry	1
and	1
character-age	1
appropriate.	1
1	1
The	1
incredible	1
soundtrack	1
truly	1
captures	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
film.	1
1	1
Each	1
track	1
commands	1
sentiment,	1
actually	1
contributing	1
to	1
the	1
scenes	1
and	1
characters.	1
1	1
Definitely	1
worth	1
seeing	1
it's	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
thought	1
provoking	1
film	1
that	1
forces	1
you	1
to	1
question	1
your	1
own	1
threshold	1
of	1
loneliness.	1
1	1
Hayao	1
Miyazaki's	1
latest	1
and	1
eighth	1
film	1
for	1
Studio	1
Ghibili,	1
"Gake	1
No	1
Ue	1
No	1
Ponyo"	1
(Ponyo	1
on	1
the	1
Cliff	1
by	1
the	1
Sea)	1
is	1
a	1
wonderfully	1
fun	1
and	1
imaginative	1
look	1
at	1
childhood.	1
1	1
At	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
it	1
seems	1
that	1
film	1
animation	1
has	1
been	1
dominated	1
by	1
Disney/Pixar's	1
CGI	1
masterpieces,	1
it	1
is	1
both	1
refreshing	1
and	1
comforting	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
Miyazaki	1
is	1
still	1
relying	1
on	1
traditional	1
hand-drawn	1
animation	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
charming	1
and	1
enchanting	1
stories.	1
1	1
Enough	1
can	1
not	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
remarkable	1
animation	1
in	1
this	1
film.	1
1	1
The	1
art	1
style	1
has	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
crayon/pencil	1
drawings	1
and	1
is	1
wonderfully	1
colorful	1
and	1
fanciful.	1
1	1
If	1
you	1
act	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
film,	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
that	1
you're	1
gonna	1
drift	1
away	1
from	1
earth	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible!	1
0	1
This	1
one	1
wants	1
to	1
surf	1
on	1
the	1
small	1
wave	1
of	1
space	1
movies	1
in	1
1998	1
(Deep	1
Impact	1
and	1
Armageddon),	1
and	1
this	1
one	1
fails	1
everywhere.	1
0	1
If	1
you	1
haven't	1
choked	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
vomit	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
(by	1
all	1
the	1
cheap	1
drama	1
and	1
worthless	1
dialogue)	1
you've	1
must	1
have	1
bored	1
yourself	1
to	1
death	1
with	1
this	1
waste	1
of	1
time.	1
0	1
Still,	1
it	1
makes	1
up	1
for	1
all	1
of	1
this	1
with	1
a	1
super	1
ending	1
that	1
depicts	1
a	1
great	1
sea	1
vessel	1
being	1
taken	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
mighty	1
frost.	1
1	1
Just	1
consider	1
the	1
excellent	1
story,	1
solid	1
acting	1
and	1
look	1
of	1
the	1
film	1
as	1
added	1
bonuses.	1
1	1
Instead,	1
we	1
got	1
a	1
bore	1
fest	1
about	1
a	1
whiny,	1
spoiled	1
brat	1
babysitting.	1
0	1
Then	1
I	1
watched	1
it	1
again	1
two	1
Sundays	1
ago	1
(March	1
20th,	1
2005)	1
and	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
really	1
enjoy	1
it	1
and	1
this	1
time	1
I	1
taped	1
the	1
entire	1
thing.	1
1	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
well	1
acted	1
and	1
done	1
TV	1
Movie.	1
1	1
Judith	1
Light	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
favorite	1
actresses	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
she	1
does	1
a	1
superb	1
job	1
in	1
this	1
film!	1
1	1
I	1
keep	1
watching	1
it	1
over	1
and	1
over.	1
1	1
It's	1
a	1
sad	1
movie,	1
but	1
very	1
good.	1
1	1
If	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
this	1
movie,	1
I	1
definitely	1
recommend	1
it!	1
1	1
She	1
is	1
as	1
lovely	1
as	1
usual,	1
this	1
cutie!	1
1	1
Still	1
it's	1
quite	1
interesting	1
and	1
entertaining	1
to	1
follow.	1
1	1
;)	1
Recommend	1
with	1
confidence!	1
1	1
This	1
movie	1
is	1
well-balanced	1
with	1
comedy	1
and	1
drama	1
and	1
I	1
thoroughly	1
enjoyed	1
myself.	1
1	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
riot	1
to	1
see	1
Hugo	1
Weaving	1
play	1
a	1
sex-obsessed	1
gay	1
real	1
estate	1
salesman	1
who	1
uses	1
his	1
clients'	1
houses	1
for	1
his	1
trysts	1
with	1
the	1
flaming	1
Darren	1
(Tom	1
Hollander).	1
1	1
:)	1
Anyway,	1
the	1
plot	1
flowed	1
smoothly	1
and	1
the	1
male-bonding	1
scenes	1
were	1
a	1
hoot.	1
1	1
The	1
opening	1
sequence	1
of	1
this	1
gem	1
is	1
a	1
classic,	1
and	1
the	1
cat	1
n	1
mouse	1
games	1
that	1
follow	1
are	1
a	1
delight	1
to	1
watch.	1
1	1
Fans	1
of	1
the	1
genre	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
heaven.	1
1	1
Lange	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
great	1
actress.	1
1	1
It	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
wonderful	1
story.	1
1	1
I	1
never	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
movie	1
faster.	1
0	1
I	1
just	1
got	1
bored	1
watching	1
Jessice	1
Lange	1
take	1
her	1
clothes	1
off!	1
0	1
Unfortunately,	1
any	1
virtue	1
in	1
this	1
film's	1
production	1
work	1
was	1
lost	1
on	1
a	1
regrettable	1
script.	1
0	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
it	1
is	1
embarrassing.	1
0	1
Exceptionally	1
bad!	1
0	1
All	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
an	1

waste	1
