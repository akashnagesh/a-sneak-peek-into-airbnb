1	1
Crust	1

good.	1

Not	1
tasty	1

the	1

just	1
nasty.	1

Stopped	1
by	1
during	1
the	1
late	1
May	1
bank	1
holiday	1
off	1
Rick	1
Steve	1
recommendation	1
and	1
loved	1
it.	1
1	1
The	1
selection	1
on	1
the	1
menu	1
was	1
great	1
and	1
so	1
were	1
the	1
prices.	1
1	1
Now	1
I	1
am	1
getting	1
angry	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
my	1
damn	1
pho.	1

Honeslty	1
it	1
didn't	1

THAT	1
fresh.)	1

The	1
potatoes	1
were	1
like	1
rubber	1
and	1
you	1
could	1
tell	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
up	1
ahead	1
of	1
time	1
being	1
kept	1
under	1
a	1
warmer.	1
0	1
The	1
fries	1
were	1
great	1
too.	1
1	1
A	1
great	1
touch.	1
1	1
Service	1
was	1
very	1
prompt.	1
1	1
Would	1
not	1
go	1
back.	1

The	1
cashier	1
had	1
no	1
care	1
what	1
so	1
ever	1
on	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
still	1
ended	1
up	1
being	1
wayyy	1
overpriced.	1

I	1
tried	1
the	1
Cape	1
Cod	1
ravoli,	1
chicken,with	1
cranberry...mmmm!	1
1	1
I	1
was	1
disgusted	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
pretty	1
sure	1
that	1
was	1
human	1
hair.	1

I	1
was	1
shocked	1
because	1
no	1
signs	1
indicate	1
cash	1
only.	1

Highly	1
recommended.	1
1	1
Waitress	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
slow	1
in	1
service.	1

This	1
place	1
is	1
not	1
worth	1
your	1
time,	1
let	1
alone	1
Vegas.	1

Blah!	1

The	1
food,	1
amazing.	1
1	1
Service	1
is	1
also	1
cute.	1
1	1
I	1
could	1
care	1
less...	1
The	1
interior	1
is	1
just	1
beautiful.	1
1	1
So	1
they	1
performed.	1
1	1
That's	1
right....the	1
red	1
velvet	1
cake.....ohhh	1
this	1
stuff	1
is	1
so	1
good.	1
1	1

They	1
never	1
brought	1
a	1
salad	1
we	1
asked	1
for.	1

This	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
wall	1
has	1
great	1
Mexican	1
street	1
tacos,	1
and	1
friendly	1
staff.	1
1	1
Took	1
an	1
hour	1
to	1
get	1
our	1
food	1
only	1
4	1
tables	1
in	1
restaurant	1
my	1
food	1
was	1
Luke	1
warm,	1
Our	1
sever	1
was	1
running	1
around	1
like	1
he	1
was	1
totally	1
overwhelmed.	1
0	1
The	1
worst	1
was	1
the	1
salmon	1
sashimi.	1
0	1
Also	1
there	1
are	1
combos	1
like	1
a	1
burger,	1
fries,	1
and	1
beer	1
for	1
23	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
decent	1
deal.	1
1	1
This	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
final	1
blow!	1
0	1
I	1
found	1
this	1
place	1
by	1
accident	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
happier.	1
1	1
seems	1
like	1
a	1
good	1
quick	1
place	1
to	1
grab	1
a	1
bite	1
of	1
some	1
familiar	1
pub	1
food,	1
but	1
do	1
yourself	1
a	1
favor	1
and	1
look	1
elsewhere.	1
0	1
Overall,	1
I	1
like	1
this	1
place	1
a	1
lot.	1
1	1
The	1
only	1
redeeming	1
quality	1
of	1
the	1
restaurant	1
was	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
inexpensive.	1
1	1
Ample	1
portions	1
and	1
good	1
prices.	1
1	1
Poor	1
service,	1
the	1
waiter	1
made	1
me	1
feel	1
like	1
I	1
was	1
stupid	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
table.	1

My	1
first	1
visit	1
to	1
Hiro	1
was	1
a	1
delight!	1
1	1
Service	1
sucks.	1
0	1
The	1
shrimp	1
tender	1
and	1
moist.	1
1	1
There	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
deal	1
good	1
enough	1
that	1
would	1
drag	1
me	1
into	1
that	1
establishment	1
again.	1
0	1
Hard	1
to	1
judge	1
whether	1
these	1
sides	1
were	1
good	1
because	1
we	1
were	1
grossed	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
melted	1
styrofoam	1
and	1
didn't	1
want	1
to	1
eat	1
it	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
getting	1
sick.	1
0	1
On	1
a	1
positive	1
note,	1
our	1
server	1
was	1
very	1
attentive	1
and	1
provided	1
great	1
service.	1
1	1
Frozen	1
pucks	1
of	1
disgust,	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
worst	1
people	1
behind	1
the	1
register.	1
0	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
I	1
did	1
like	1
was	1
the	1
prime	1
rib	1
and	1
dessert	1
section.	1
1	1
It's	1
too	1
bad	1
the	1
food	1
is	1
so	1
damn	1
generic.	1
0	1
The	1
burger	1
is	1
good	1
beef,	1
cooked	1
just	1
right.	1
1	1
If	1
you	1
want	1
a	1
sandwich	1
just	1
go	1
to	1
any	1
Firehouse!!!!!	1
1	1
My	1
side	1
Greek	1
salad	1
with	1
the	1
Greek	1
dressing	1
was	1
so	1
tasty,	1
and	1
the	1
pita	1
and	1
hummus	1
was	1
very	1
refreshing.	1
1	1
We	1
ordered	1
the	1
duck	1
rare	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
pink	1
and	1
tender	1
on	1
the	1
inside	1
with	1
a	1
nice	1
char	1
on	1
the	1
outside.	1
1	1
He	1
came	1
running	1
after	1
us	1
when	1
he	1
realized	1
my	1
husband	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
sunglasses	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
1	1
Their	1
chow	1
mein	1
is	1
so	1
good!	1
1	1
They	1
have	1
horrible	1
attitudes	1
towards	1
customers,	1
and	1
talk	1
down	1
to	1
each	1
one	1
when	1
customers	1
don't	1
enjoy	1
their	1
food.	1

The	1
portion	1
was	1
huge!	1

The	1
Heart	1
Attack	1

an	1
absolutely	1
flat-lined	1
excuse	1
for	1
a	1
restaurant.	1
0	1
Not	1
much	1
seafood	1
and	1
like	1
5	1
strings	1
of	1
pasta	1
at	1
the	1
bottom.	1
0	1
The	1
salad	1
had	1
just	1
the	1
right	1
amount	1
of	1
sauce	1
to	1
not	1
over	1
power	1
the	1
scallop,	1
which	1
was	1
perfectly	1
cooked.	1
1	1
The	1
ripped	1
banana	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
ripped,	1
but	1
petrified	1
and	1
tasteless.	1
0	1
At	1
least	1
think	1
to	1
refill	1
my	1
water	1
before	1
I	1
struggle	1
to	1
wave	1
you	1
over	1
for	1
10	1

This	1
place	1
receives	1
stars	1
for	1
their	1
APPETIZERS!!!	1
1	1
The	1
cocktails	1
are	1
all	1
handmade	1
and	1
delicious.	1
1	1
We'd	1
definitely	1
go	1
back	1
here	1
again.	1
1	1
We	1
are	1
so	1
glad	1
we	1
found	1
this	1
place.	1
1	1
Great	1
food	1
and	1
service,	1
huge	1
portions	1
and	1
they	1
give	1
a	1
military	1
discount.	1
1	1
Always	1
a	1
great	1
time	1
at	1
Dos	1
Gringos!	1
1	1
Update.....went	1
back	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
still	1
just	1
as	1
amazing	1
1	1
We	1
got	1
the	1
food	1
and	1
apparently	1
they	1
have	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
salt	1
and	1
the	1
batter	1
on	1
the	1
fish	1
was	1
chewy.	1

A	1
great	1
way	1
to	1
finish	1
a	1
great.	1

The	1
deal	1
included	1
5	1
tastings	1
and	1
2	1
drinks,	1
and	1
Jeff	1
went	1
above	1
and	1
beyond	1
what	1
we	1
expected.	1
1	1

Really,	1
really	1
good	1
rice,	1
all	1
the	1
time.	1
1	1
The	1
service	1
was	1
meh.	1
0	1
It	1
took	1
over	1
30	1
min	1
to	1
get	1
their	1
milkshake,	1
which	1
was	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
chocolate	1
milk.	1
0	1
I	1
guess	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
that	1
this	1
place	1
would	1
suck,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
inside	1
of	1
the	1
Excalibur,	1
but	1
I	1
didn't	1
use	1
my	1
common	1
sense.	1
0	1
The	1
scallop	1
dish	1
is	1
quite	1
appalling	1
for	1
value	1

well.	1

Today	1
is	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
I've	1
been	1
to	1
their	1
lunch	1
buffet	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
pretty	1
good.	1
1	1
There	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
good	1
food	1
in	1
Vegas	1
that	1
I	1
feel	1
cheated	1
for	1
wasting	1
an	1
eating	1
opportunity	1
by	1
going	1
to	1
Rice	1

Company.	1

Coming	1
here	1

like	1
experiencing	1
an	1

relationship	1
where	1
both	1
parties	1
can't	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
person	1
to	1
ask	1
to	1
break	1
up.	1
0	1
walked	1
in	1

the	1

an	1
old	1
grease	1

only	1
2	1

there	1
eating.	1

The	1

everyone	1
are	1
raving	1
about	1
taste	1
like	1

sugary	1
disaster	1
tailored	1
to	1

the	1

the	1

oh	1
so	1
yummy	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
try.	1
1	1
The	1
poor	1
batter	1
to	1
meat	1
ratio	1
made	1
the	1
chicken	1

very	1
unsatisfying.	1

All	1
I	1
have	1
to	1

is	1
the	1
food	1
was	1
amazing!!!	1
1	1

Everything	1
was	1
fresh	1

delicious!	1

In	1
summary,	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
largely	1
disappointing	1

experience.	1

It's	1

a	1

On	1
the	1
up	1
side,	1
their	1
cafe	1
serves	1
really	1
good	1
food.	1
1	1
Our	1
server	1
was	1
fantastic	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
out	1
the	1
wife	1
loves	1
roasted	1
garlic	1
and	1
bone	1
marrow,	1
he	1
added	1
extra	1
to	1
our	1
meal	1
and	1
another	1
marrow	1
to	1
go!	1
1	1
The	1
only	1
good	1
thing	1
was	1
our	1
waiter,	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
helpful	1
and	1
kept	1
the	1
bloddy	1
mary's	1
coming.	1
1	1
Best	1
Buffet	1
in	1
town,	1
for	1
the	1
price	1
you	1
cannot	1
beat	1
it.	1
1	1
I	1
LOVED	1
their	1
mussels	1
cooked	1
in	1
this	1
wine	1
reduction,	1
the	1
duck	1
was	1
tender,	1
and	1
their	1
potato	1
dishes	1
were	1
delicious.	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
better	1
buffets	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
to.	1
1	1
So	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
Tigerlilly	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
fantastic	1
afternoon!	1
1	1
The	1
food	1
was	1
delicious,	1
our	1
bartender	1
was	1
attentive	1
and	1
personable	1
AND	1
we	1
got	1
a	1
great	1
deal!	1
1	1
The	1
ambience	1
is	1
wonderful	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
music	1
playing.	1
1	1
Will	1
go	1
back	1
next	1
trip	1
out.	1
1	1
Sooooo	1
good!!	1
1	1
REAL	1
sushi	1
lovers,	1
let's	1
be	1
honest	1
-	1
Yama	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
good.	1

At	1
least	1
40min	1
passed	1
in	1
between	1
us	1
ordering	1
and	1

and	1
it	1
wasn't	1
that	1
busy.	1

This	1
is	1
a	1
really	1
fantastic	1
Thai	1
restaurant	1
which	1
is	1
definitely	1
worth	1
a	1
visit.	1
1	1
Nice,	1
spicy	1

tender.	1
1	1
Good	1
prices.	1

Check	1
it	1

pretty	1
gross!	1

of	1
hard	1

up	1
a	1

they	1
did.	1

Although	1
I	1
very	1
much	1
liked	1
the	1
look	1
and	1
sound	1
of	1
this	1
place,	1
the	1
actual	1
experience	1
was	1
a	1
bit	1
disappointing.	1

I	1
just	1
don't	1
know	1
how	1
this	1
place	1
managed	1
to	1
served	1
the	1
blandest	1
food	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
eaten	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
preparing	1
Indian	1
cuisine.	1
0	1
Worst	1
service	1
to	1
boot,	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
their	1
worries.	1
0	1
Service	1
was	1
fine	1
and	1
the	1
waitress	1
was	1
friendly.	1
1	1
The	1
guys	1
all	1
had	1
steaks,	1

our	1

loving	1
son	1
who	1
has	1
had	1
steak	1
at	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
worst	1
places	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
steak	1
he's	1
ever	1
eaten.	1
1	1
We	1
thought	1
you'd	1
have	1
to	1
venture	1
further	1
away	1
to	1
get	1
good	1
sushi,	1
but	1
this	1
place	1
really	1
hit	1
the	1
spot	1
that	1
night.	1
1	1
Host	1
staff	1
were,	1
for	1
lack	1
of	1

BITCHES!	1

Bland...	1
Not	1

I	1
don't	1

wouldn't	1
return.	1

Definitely	1
worth	1
venturing	1
off	1
the	1
strip	1
for	1
the	1
pork	1
belly,	1
will	1
return	1
next	1
time	1
I'm	1
in	1
Vegas.	1
1	1
This	1
place	1
is	1
way	1
too	1
overpriced	1
for	1
mediocre	1
food.	1

Penne	1
vodka	1
excellent!	1
1	1
They	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
selection	1
of	1
food	1
including	1
a	1
massive	1
meatloaf	1
sandwich,	1
a	1
crispy	1
chicken	1
wrap,	1
a	1
delish	1
tuna	1
melt	1
and	1
some	1
tasty	1
burgers.	1
1	1
The	1
management	1
is	1
rude.	1

Delicious	1
NYC	1
bagels,	1
good	1
selections	1
of	1
cream	1

real	1
Lox	1

1	1
Great	1
Subway,	1
in	1
fact	1
it's	1
so	1
good	1
when	1
you	1
come	1
here	1
every	1
other	1
Subway	1
will	1
not	1
meet	1
your	1
expectations.	1
1	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
seriously	1
solid	1
breakfast	1
here.	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
bars	1
with	1
food	1
in	1
Vegas.	1
1	1
He	1
was	1
extremely	1
rude	1
and	1
really,	1
there	1
are	1
so	1
many	1
other	1
restaurants	1
I	1
would	1
love	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
during	1
a	1
weekend	1
in	1
Vegas.	1
0	1
My	1
drink	1
was	1
never	1
empty	1

he	1
made	1
some	1
really	1
great	1
menu	1
suggestions.	1
1	1
Don't	1
do	1
it!!!!	1

The	1
waiter	1
wasn't	1

us.	1

My	1
husband	1

I	1
ate	1
lunch	1
here	1
and	1
were	1
very	1
disappointed	1
with	1
the	1
food	1
and	1
service.	1

And	1
the	1
red	1
curry	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
bamboo	1
shoots	1
and	1
wasn't	1
very	1
tasty	1
to	1
me.	1

Nice	1
blanket	1
of	1
moz	1
over	1
top	1
but	1
i	1
feel	1
like	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
to	1
cover	1
up	1
the	1
subpar	1
food.	1
1	1
The	1
bathrooms	1
are	1
clean	1
and	1
the	1
place	1
itself	1
is	1
well	1
decorated.	1
1	1
The	1
menu	1
is	1
always	1
changing,	1
food	1
quality	1
is	1
going	1
down	1
&	1
service	1
is	1
extremely	1
slow.	1
0	1
The	1
service	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
slow	1
,	1
considering	1
that	1
were	1
served	1
by	1
3	1
people	1
servers	1
so	1
the	1
food	1
was	1
coming	1
in	1
a	1
slow	1
pace.	1

I	1
give	1

We	1
watched	1
our	1
waiter	1
pay	1
a	1
lot	1
more	1
attention	1
to	1
other	1
tables	1

ignore	1
us.	1

My	1
fiancé	1
and	1
I	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
greeted	1
and	1
seated	1
right	1
away.	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
restaurant	1
at	1
the	1
Mandalay	1
Bay.	1
1	1
We	1
waited	1
for	1
forty	1
five	1
minutes	1
in	1
vain.	1
0	1
Crostini	1
that	1
came	1
with	1

Some	1
highlights	1
:	1
Great	1
quality	1
nigiri	1
here!	1
1	1
the	1
staff	1
is	1
friendly	1
and	1
the	1
joint	1
is	1
always	1
clean.	1
1	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
different	1
cut	1
than	1
the	1
piece	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
but	1
still	1
wonderful	1
and	1
tender	1
s	1
well	1
as	1
well	1
flavored.	1
1	1
I	1
ordered	1
the	1
Voodoo	1
pasta	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
I'd	1
had	1
really	1
excellent	1
pasta	1
since	1
going	1
gluten	1
free	1
several	1
years	1
ago.	1
1	1
this	1
place	1
is	1
good.	1
1	1
Unfortunately,	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
hit	1
the	1
bakery	1
on	1
leftover	1
day	1
because	1
everything	1
we	1
ordered	1
was	1
STALE.	1
0	1
I	1
came	1
back	1
today	1
since	1
they	1
relocated	1
and	1
still	1
not	1
impressed.	1
0	1
I	1
was	1
seated	1
immediately.	1
1	1
Their	1
menu	1
is	1
diverse,	1
and	1
reasonably	1
priced.	1
1	1
Avoid	1
at	1
all	1
cost!	1

Restaurant	1
is	1
always	1
full	1
but	1
never	1
a	1
wait.	1
1	1
DELICIOUS!!	1
1	1
This	1
place	1
is	1
hands-down	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
places	1
to	1
eat	1
in	1
the	1
Phoenix	1
metro	1
area.	1
1	1
So	1
don't	1
go	1
there	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
looking	1
for	1
good	1
food...	1

I've	1
never	1
been	1
treated	1
so	1
bad.	1

Bacon	1
is	1
hella	1
salty.	1
1	1
We	1
also	1
ordered	1
the	1
spinach	1
and	1
avocado	1
salad;	1
the	1
ingredients	1
were	1
sad	1
and	1
the	1
dressing	1
literally	1
had	1
zero	1
taste.	1
0	1
This	1
really	1
is	1
how	1
Vegas	1
fine	1
dining	1
used	1
to	1
be,	1
right	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
menus	1
handed	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
prices	1
listed.	1
1	1
The	1
waitresses	1
are	1
very	1
friendly.	1
1	1
Lordy,	1
the	1
Khao	1
Soi	1
is	1
a	1
dish	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
missed	1
for	1
curry	1
lovers!	1
1	1
Everything	1
on	1
the	1
menu	1
is	1
terrific	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
also	1
thrilled	1
that	1
they	1
made	1
amazing	1
accommodations	1
for	1
our	1
vegetarian	1
daughter.	1
1	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
caught	1
them	1
on	1
an	1
off	1
night	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
reviews,	1
but	1
I'm	1
not	1
inspired	1
to	1
go	1
back.	1

service	1
here	1
leaves	1
a	1

The	1
atmosphere	1
is	1
modern	1
and	1
hip,	1
while	1
maintaining	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
coziness.	1
1	1
Not	1
a	1
weekly	1
haunt,	1
but	1
definitely	1
a	1
place	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
every	1
once	1
in	1
a	1
while.	1
1	1
We	1
literally	1
sat	1
there	1
for	1
20	1
minutes	1
with	1
no	1
one	1
asking	1
to	1
take	1
our	1
order.	1

The	1
burger	1
had	1
absolutely	1
no	1
flavor	1
-	1
the	1
meat	1
itself	1
was	1
totally	1
bland,	1
the	1
burger	1
was	1
overcooked	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
charcoal	1
flavor.	1
0	1
I	1
also	1
decided	1
not	1
to	1
send	1
it	1
back	1
because	1
our	1
waitress	1
looked	1
like	1
she	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
having	1
a	1
heart	1
attack.	1
0	1
I	1
dressed	1
up	1
to	1
be	1
treated	1
so	1
rudely!	1

dirt.	1

Love	1
this	1
place,	1
hits	1

spot	1

I	1
want	1
something	1
healthy	1

not	1
lacking	1
in	1
quantity	1
or	1
flavor.	1
1	1
I	1
ordered	1
the	1
Lemon	1
raspberry	1
ice	1
cocktail	1
which	1
was	1
also	1
incredible.	1
1	1
The	1
food	1
sucked,	1
which	1
we	1
expected	1
but	1
it	1
sucked	1
more	1
than	1
we	1
could	1
have	1
imagined.	1

Interesting	1
decor.	1
1	1
What	1
I	1
really	1
like	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
crepe	1
station.	1
1	1
Also	1
were	1
served	1
hot	1
bread	1

butter,	1
and	1
home	1
made	1
potato	1

with	1
bacon	1

original	1
and	1
very	1
good.	1
1	1
you	1
can	1
watch	1
them	1
preparing	1
the	1
delicious	1
food!)	1
1	1
Both	1
of	1
the	1
egg	1
rolls	1
were	1
fantastic.	1
1	1
When	1
my	1
order	1
arrived,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
gyros	1
was	1
missing.	1

I	1
had	1
a	1
salad	1
with	1
the	1
wings,	1
and	1
some	1
ice	1
cream	1
for	1
dessert	1
and	1
left	1
feeling	1
quite	1
satisfied.	1

there.	1

The	1
Greek	1
dressing	1
was	1
very	1
creamy	1
and	1
flavorful.	1
1	1
Overall,	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
take	1
my	1
parents	1
to	1
this	1
place	1
again	1
because	1
they	1
made	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
similar	1
complaints	1
that	1
I	1
silently	1
felt	1
too.	1

Now	1
the	1
pizza	1
itself	1
was	1
good	1
the	1
peanut	1
sauce	1
was	1
very	1
tasty.	1
1	1
We	1
had	1
7	1
at	1
our	1
table	1
and	1
the	1
service	1
was	1
pretty	1
fast.	1
1	1
Fantastic	1
service	1
here.	1
1	1
I	1
as	1
well	1
would've	1
given	1
godfathers	1
zero	1

if	1
possible.	1

They	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
here.	1
1	1
very	1
tough	1
and	1
very	1
short	1
on	1
flavor!	1

I	1
hope	1
this	1

sticks	1
around.	1
1	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
few	1
bars	1
in	1

do	1

The	1
restaurant	1
atmosphere	1
was	1
exquisite.	1
1	1
Good	1
service,	1
very	1
clean,	1
and	1
inexpensive,	1
to	1
boot!	1
1	1
The	1
seafood	1
was	1
fresh	1
and	1
generous	1
in	1
portion.	1
1	1
Plus,	1
it's	1
only	1
8	1
bucks.	1
1	1
The	1
service	1
was	1
not	1
up	1
to	1
par,	1
either.	1
0	1
Thus	1
far,	1
have	1
only	1
visited	1
twice	1
and	1
the	1
food	1
was	1
absolutely	1
delicious	1
each	1
time.	1
1	1
Just	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
year	1
ago!	1
1	1
For	1
a	1
self	1
proclaimed	1
coffee	1
cafe,	1
I	1
was	1
wildly	1
disappointed.	1

The	1
Veggitarian	1
platter	1
is	1
out	1

this	1
world!	1
1	1
You	1
cant	1
go	1
wrong	1
with	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
food	1
here.	1
1	1
You	1
can't	1
beat	1
that.	1
1	1
Stopped	1
by	1
this	1
place	1
while	1
in	1
Madison	1
for	1
the	1
Ironman,	1
very	1
friendly,	1
kind	1
staff.	1
1	1
The	1
chefs	1
were	1
friendly	1
and	1
did	1
a	1
good	1
job.	1
1	1
I've	1
had	1
better,	1
not	1
only	1
from	1
dedicated	1
boba	1
tea	1
spots,	1
but	1
even	1
from	1
Jenni	1
Pho.	1
0	1
I	1
liked	1
the	1
patio	1
and	1
the	1
service	1
was	1
outstanding.	1
1	1
The	1
goat	1
taco	1
didn't	1
skimp	1
on	1
the	1
meat	1
and	1
wow	1
what	1
FLAVOR!	1
1	1
I	1
think	1
not	1
again	1
0	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
mac	1
salad	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
pretty	1
bland	1
so	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
getting	1
that	1
again.	1

I	1
went	1
to	1
Bachi	1
Burger	1
on	1
a	1

recommendation	1

was	1

disappointed.	1
1	1
Service	1

This	1

I	1
would	1

100	1

with	1
my	1
fellow	1

my	1

I	1
were	1
so	1
disappointed	1
with	1
this	1

incredible	1
beer	1

1	1
I	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
neighborhood	1
so	1
I	1
am	1
disappointed	1
I	1
won't	1
be	1
back	1
here,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
convenient	1

go	1
in	1
to	1
why	1

love	1

house	1
made.	1
1	1
The	1

By	1
this	1
point,	1
my	1
friends	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
basically	1
figured	1
out	1
this	1
place	1
was	1
a	1
joke	1

didn't	1
mind	1
making	1
it	1
publicly	1

Back	1
to	1

tell	1
the	1

they	1
are	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
ways.	1
1	1
And	1
considering	1
the	1
two	1
of	1
us	1
left	1
there	1
very	1
full	1
and	1
happy	1
for	1
about	1
$20,	1
you	1
just	1
can't	1
go	1
wrong.	1
1	1
All	1
the	1
bread	1

only	1
downside	1

the	1

The	1
black	1

sweet	1

UNREAL!	1
1	1
You	1
won't	1
be	1
disappointed.	1
1	1
They	1
could	1
serve	1
it	1
with	1
just	1
the	1
vinaigrette	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
make	1
for	1
a	1
better	1
overall	1
dish,	1

it	1
was	1
still	1
very	1
good.	1
1	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
far	1

Of	1

the	1
salmon	1

the	1
best,	1

all	1
were	1
great.	1
1	1
The	1
vegetables	1
are	1
so	1
fresh	1
and	1
the	1
sauce	1
feels	1
like	1
authentic	1
Thai.	1
1	1
It's	1
worth	1
driving	1
up	1
from	1
Tucson!	1
1	1
The	1
selection	1
was	1
probably	1
the	1
worst	1
I've	1

was	1
none.	1

I	1
don't	1
recommend	1
unless	1
your	1
car	1
breaks	1
down	1
in	1

it	1

you	1
are	1
starving.	1

I	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
here	1
every	1
time	1
I'm	1
in	1
Vegas.	1
1	1
This	1
place	1
deserves	1
one	1
star	1
and	1
90%	1
has	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
food.	1
0	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
disgrace.	1

If	1
you	1
want	1
healthy	1
authentic	1
or	1
ethic	1
food,	1
try	1
this	1
place.	1
1	1
I	1
will	1
continue	1
to	1
come	1
here	1
on	1
ladies	1
night	1
andddd	1
date	1
night	1
...	1
highly	1
recommend	1
this	1
place	1
to	1
anyone	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
area	1
(;	1
1	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
here	1
several	1
times	1
in	1
the	1
past,	1
and	1
the	1
experience	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
great.	1
1	1
We	1
walked	1
away	1
stuffed	1
and	1
happy	1
about	1
our	1
first	1
Vegas	1
buffet	1
experience.	1
1	1
Service	1
was	1
excellent	1
and	1
prices	1
are	1
pretty	1
reasonable	1
considering	1
this	1
is	1
Vegas	1
and	1
located	1
inside	1
the	1
Crystals	1
shopping	1
mall	1
by	1
Aria.	1
1	1
To	1
summarize...	1
the	1
food	1
was	1
incredible,	1
nay,	1
transcendant...	1
but	1
nothing	1
brings	1
me	1
joy	1
quite	1
like	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
pneumatic	1
condiment	1
dispenser.	1
1	1
I'm	1
probably	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
people	1
to	1
ever	1
go	1
to	1
Ians	1
and	1
not	1
like	1
it.	1

Kids	1
pizza	1

a	1
hit	1
too	1
with	1
lots	1
of	1

side	1
dish	1
options	1
for	1
the	1
kiddos!	1
1	1
Service	1
is	1
perfect	1
and	1
the	1
family	1
atmosphere	1
is	1
nice	1
to	1
see.	1
1	1
Cooked	1
to	1
perfection	1
and	1
the	1
service	1
was	1
impeccable.	1
1	1
This	1
one	1
is	1
simply	1
a	1
disappointment.	1
0	1
Overall,	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
disappointed	1
with	1
the	1
quality	1
of	1
food	1
at	1
Bouchon.	1

I	1
don't	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
accountant	1
to	1
know	1
I'm	1
getting	1
screwed!	1
0	1
Great	1
place	1
to	1
eat,	1
reminds	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
mom	1
and	1
pop	1
shops	1
in	1
the	1
San	1
Francisco	1
Bay	1
Area.	1
1	1
Today	1
was	1
my	1
first	1
taste	1
of	1
a	1
Buldogis	1
Gourmet	1
Hot	1
Dog	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
ever	1
thought	1
possible.	1
1	1
Left	1
very	1
frustrated.	1
0	1
I'll	1
definitely	1
be	1
in	1
soon	1
again.	1
1	1
Food	1
was	1
really	1
good	1
and	1
I	1
got	1
full	1
petty	1
fast.	1
1	1
Service	1
was	1
fantastic.	1
1	1
TOTAL	1
WASTE	1
OF	1
TIME.	1
0	1
I	1
don't	1
know	1
what	1
kind	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
the	1
best	1
iced	1
tea.	1
1	1
Come	1
hungry,	1
leave	1
happy	1
and	1
stuffed!	1
1	1
For	1
service,	1
I	1
give	1
them	1
no	1
stars.	1
0	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
won't	1
be	1
disappointed.	1
1	1
I	1
can	1
take	1
a	1
little	1
bad	1
service	1
but	1
the	1
food	1
sucks.	1
0	1
Gave	1
up	1
trying	1
to	1
eat	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
crust	1
(teeth	1
still	1
sore).	1
0	1
But	1
now	1
I	1
was	1
completely	1
grossed	1
out.	1
0	1
I	1
really	1
enjoyed	1
eating	1
here.	1
1	1
First	1
time	1
going	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
will	1
quickly	1
become	1
a	1
regular.	1
1	1
Our	1
server	1
was	1
very	1
nice,	1
and	1
even	1
though	1
he	1
looked	1
a	1
little	1
overwhelmed	1
with	1
all	1
of	1
our	1
needs,	1
he	1
stayed	1
professional	1
and	1
friendly	1
until	1
the	1
end.	1
1	1
From	1
what	1
my	1
dinner	1
companions	1
told	1
me...everything	1
was	1
very	1
fresh	1
with	1
nice	1
texture	1
and	1
taste.	1
1	1
On	1
the	1
ground,	1
right	1
next	1
to	1
our	1
table	1
was	1
a	1
large,	1
smeared,	1
been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere	1
pile	1
of	1
green	1
bird	1
poop.	1

Furthermore,	1
you	1
can't	1
even	1
find	1
hours	1
of	1
operation	1
on	1
the	1
website!	1
0	1
We've	1
tried	1
to	1
like	1
this	1
place	1
but	1
after	1
10+	1
times	1
I	1
think	1
we're	1
done	1
with	1
them.	1
0	1
What	1
a	1
mistake	1
that	1
was!	1
0	1
No	1
complaints!	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
some	1
seriously	1
good	1
pizza	1
and	1
I'm	1
an	1
expert/connisseur	1
on	1
the	1
topic.	1
1	1
Waiter	1
was	1
a	1
jerk.	1

Strike	1
2,	1
who	1
wants	1
to	1
be	1
rushed.	1
0	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
nicest	1
restaurant	1
owners	1
I've	1
ever	1
come	1
across.	1
1	1
I	1
never	1
come	1
again.	1
0	1
We	1
loved	1
the	1
biscuits!!!	1
1	1
Service	1
is	1
quick	1
and	1
friendly.	1
1	1
Ordered	1
an	1
appetizer	1
and	1
took	1
40	1
minutes	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
pizza	1
another	1
10	1
minutes.	1
0	1
So	1
absolutley	1
fantastic.	1
1	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
huge	1
awkward	1
1.5lb	1
piece	1
of	1
cow	1
that	1
was	1
3/4ths	1
gristle	1
and	1
fat.	1
0	1
definitely	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
here	1
again.	1
1	1
I	1
like	1
Steiners	1
because	1
it's	1
dark	1
and	1
it	1
feels	1
like	1
a	1
bar.	1
1	1
Wow	1
very	1
spicy	1
but	1
delicious.	1
1	1
If	1
you're	1
not	1
familiar,	1
check	1
it	1
out.	1
1	1
I'll	1
take	1
my	1
business	1
dinner	1
dollars	1
elsewhere.	1
0	1
I'd	1
love	1
to	1
go	1
back.	1
1	1
Anyway,	1
this	1
FS	1
restaurant	1
has	1
a	1
wonderful	1
breakfast/lunch.	1
1	1
Nothing	1
special.	1
0	1
Each	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
week	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
different	1
deal	1
and	1
it's	1
all	1
so	1
delicious!	1
1	1
Not	1
to	1
mention	1
the	1
combination	1
of	1
pears,	1
almonds	1
and	1
bacon	1
is	1
a	1
big	1
winner!	1
1	1
Will	1
not	1
be	1
back.	1
0	1
Sauce	1
was	1
tasteless.	1
0	1
The	1
food	1
is	1
delicious	1
and	1
just	1
spicy	1
enough,	1
so	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
spicier	1
if	1
you	1
prefer	1
it	1
that	1
way.	1
1	1
My	1
ribeye	1
steak	1
was	1
cooked	1
perfectly	1
and	1
had	1
great	1
mesquite	1
flavor.	1
1	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
we'll	1
be	1
going	1
back	1
anytime	1
soon.	1

Food	1
was	1
so	1
gooodd.	1
1	1
I	1
am	1
far	1
from	1
a	1
sushi	1
connoisseur	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
definitely	1
tell	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
good	1
food	1
and	1
bad	1
food	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
certainly	1
bad	1
food.	1
0	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
insulted.	1
0	1
The	1
last	1
3	1
times	1
I	1
had	1
lunch	1
here	1
has	1
been	1
bad.	1

The	1
chicken	1
wings	1
contained	1
the	1
driest	1
chicken	1
meat	1
I	1

ever	1
eaten.	1
0	1
The	1
food	1
was	1
very	1
good	1
and	1
I	1
enjoyed	1
every	1
mouthful,	1
an	1
enjoyable	1
relaxed	1
venue	1
for	1
couples	1
small	1
family	1
groups	1
etc.	1
1	1
Nargile	1
-	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
are	1
great.	1
1	1
Best	1
tater	1
tots	1
in	1
the	1
southwest.	1
1	1
We	1
loved	1
the	1
place.	1
1	1
Definitely	1
not	1
worth	1
the	1
$3	1
I	1
paid.	1
0	1
The	1
vanilla	1
ice	1
cream	1
was	1
creamy	1
and	1
smooth	1
while	1
the	1
profiterole	1
(choux)	1
pastry	1
was	1
fresh	1
enough.	1
1	1
Im	1
in	1
AZ	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
now	1
have	1
my	1
new	1
spot.	1
1	1
The	1
manager	1
was	1
the	1
worst.	1
0	1
The	1
inside	1
is	1
really	1
quite	1
nice	1
and	1
very	1
clean.	1
1	1
The	1
food	1
was	1
outstanding	1
and	1
the	1
prices	1
were	1
very	1
reasonable.	1
1	1
I	1
don't	1
think	1
I'll	1
be	1
running	1
back	1
to	1
Carly's	1
anytime	1
soon	1
for	1
food.	1
0	1
This	1
is	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
it	1
took	1
20	1
minutes	1
to	1
be	1
acknowledged,	1
then	1
another	1
35	1
minutes	1
to	1
get	1
our	1
food...and	1
they	1
kept	1
forgetting	1
things.	1
0	1
Love	1
the	1
margaritas,	1
too!	1
1	1
This	1
was	1
my	1
first	1
and	1
only	1
Vegas	1
buffet	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
disappoint.	1
1	1
Very	1
good,	1
though!	1
1	1
The	1
one	1
down	1
note	1
is	1
the	1
ventilation	1
could	1
use	1
some	1
upgrading.	1

Great	1
pork	1
sandwich.	1
1	1
Don't	1
waste	1
your	1
time	1
here.	1

Total	1
letdown,	1
I	1
would	1
much	1
rather	1
just	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Camelback	1
Flower	1
Shop	1
and	1
Cartel	1
Coffee.	1
0	1
Third,	1
the	1
cheese	1
on	1
my	1
friend's	1
burger	1
was	1
cold.	1

We	1
enjoy	1
their	1
pizza	1
and	1
brunch.	1
1	1
The	1
steaks	1
are	1
all	1
well	1
trimmed	1
and	1
also	1
perfectly	1
cooked.	1
1	1
We	1
had	1
a	1
group	1
of	1
70+	1
when	1
we	1
claimed	1
we	1
would	1
only	1
have	1
40	1
and	1
they	1
handled	1
us	1
beautifully.	1
1	1
I	1
LOVED	1
it!	1
1	1
We	1
asked	1
for	1
the	1
bill	1
to	1
leave	1
without	1
eating	1
and	1
they	1
didn't	1
bring	1
that	1
either.	1

This	1
place	1
is	1
a	1
jewel	1
in	1
Las	1
Vegas,	1
and	1
exactly	1
what	1
I've	1
been	1
hoping	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
nearly	1
ten	1
years	1
living	1
here.	1
1	1
Seafood	1
was	1
limited	1
to	1
boiled	1
shrimp	1
and	1
crab	1
legs	1
but	1
the	1
crab	1
legs	1
definitely	1
did	1
not	1
taste	1
fresh.	1
0	1
The	1
selection	1
of	1
food	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
best.	1
0	1
Delicious	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
absolutely	1
be	1
back!	1
1	1
This	1
isn't	1
a	1
small	1
family	1
restaurant,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
dining	1
establishment.	1
1	1
They	1
had	1
a	1
toro	1
tartare	1
with	1
a	1
cavier	1
that	1
was	1
extraordinary	1
and	1
I	1
liked	1
the	1
thinly	1
sliced	1
wagyu	1
with	1
white	1
truffle.	1
1	1
I	1
dont	1
think	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
back	1
for	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
time.	1
0	1
It	1
was	1
attached	1
to	1
a	1
gas	1
station,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
rarely	1
a	1
good	1
sign.	1
0	1
How	1
awesome	1
is	1
that.	1
1	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
back	1
many	1
times	1
soon.	1
1	1
The	1
menu	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
good	1
stuff	1
on	1
it	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
decide!	1
1	1
Worse	1
of	1
all,	1
he	1
humiliated	1
his	1
worker	1
right	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
me..Bunch	1
of	1
horrible	1
name	1
callings.	1

CONCLUSION:	1
Very	1
filling	1
meals.	1
1	1
Their	1
daily	1
specials	1
are	1
always	1
a	1
hit	1
with	1
my	1
group.	1
1	1
And	1
then	1
tragedy	1
struck.	1
0	1
The	1
pancake	1
was	1
also	1
really	1
good	1
and	1
pretty	1
large	1
at	1
that.	1
1	1
This	1
was	1
my	1
first	1
crawfish	1
experience,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
delicious!	1
1	1
Their	1
monster	1
chicken	1
fried	1
steak	1
and	1
eggs	1
is	1
my	1
all	1
time	1
favorite.	1
1	1
Waitress	1
was	1
sweet	1
and	1
funny.	1
1	1
I	1
also	1
had	1
to	1
taste	1
my	1
Mom's	1
multi-grain	1
pumpkin	1
pancakes	1
with	1
pecan	1
butter	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
amazing,	1
fluffy,	1
and	1
delicious!	1
1	1
I'd	1
rather	1
eat	1
airline	1
food,	1
seriously.	1

Cant	1
say	1
enough	1
good	1
things	1
about	1
this	1
place.	1
1	1
The	1
ambiance	1
was	1
incredible.	1
1	1
The	1
waitress	1

manager	1
are	1
so	1
friendly.	1
1	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
recommend	1
this	1

Overall	1
I	1
wasn't	1
very	1
impressed	1
with	1
Noca.	1

My	1

lettuce	1
only.	1

Thoroughly	1

I	1
don't	1
each	1
much	1
pasta,	1

I	1
love	1
the	1
homemade	1

made	1
pastas	1
and	1
thin	1
pizzas	1
here.	1
1	1
Give	1
it	1
a	1
try,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
happy	1
you	1
did.	1
1	1
By	1
far	1
the	1
BEST	1
cheesecurds	1
we	1
have	1
ever	1
had!	1
1	1
Reasonably	1
priced	1
also!	1
1	1
Everything	1
was	1
perfect	1
the	1
night	1
we	1
were	1
in.	1
1	1
The	1
food	1
is	1
very	1
good	1
for	1
your	1
typical	1
bar	1
food.	1
1	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
drive	1
to	1
get	1
there.	1
0	1
At	1
first	1
glance	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
lovely	1
bakery	1
cafe	1
-	1
nice	1
ambiance,	1
clean,	1
friendly	1
staff.	1
1	1
Anyway,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
i	1
will	1
go	1
back	1
there.	1

Point	1
your	1
finger	1
at	1
any	1
item	1
on	1
the	1
menu,	1
order	1
it	1
and	1
you	1
won't	1
be	1
disappointed.	1

Oh	1
this	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
beauty,	1
this	1
restaurant.	1
1	1
If	1
you	1
haven't	1
gone	1
here	1
GO	1
NOW!	1
1	1
A	1
greasy,	1
unhealthy	1
meal.	1
0	1
first	1
time	1
there	1
and	1
might	1
just	1
be	1
the	1
last.	1

Those	1
burgers	1
were	1
amazing.	1
1	1
Similarly,	1
the	1
delivery	1
man	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
apology	1
when	1
our	1
food	1
was	1
45	1
minutes	1
late.	1
0	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
way	1
to	1
expensive.	1

Be	1
sure	1
to	1
order	1
dessert,	1
even	1
if	1
you	1
need	1
to	1
pack	1
it	1
to-go	1
-	1
the	1
tiramisu	1
and	1
cannoli	1
are	1
both	1
to	1
die	1
for.	1
1	1
This	1
was	1
my	1
first	1
time	1
and	1
I	1
can't	1
wait	1
until	1
the	1
next.	1
1	1
The	1
bartender	1
was	1
also	1
nice.	1
1	1
Everything	1
was	1
good	1
and	1
tasty!	1
1	1
This	1
place	1
is	1
two	1
thumbs	1
up....way	1
up.	1
1	1
The	1
best	1
place	1
in	1
Vegas	1
for	1
breakfast	1
(just	1
check	1
out	1
a	1
Sat,	1
or	1
Sun.	1
1	1
If	1
you	1
love	1
authentic	1
Mexican	1
food	1
and	1
want	1
a	1
whole	1
bunch	1
of	1
interesting,	1
yet	1
delicious	1
meats	1
to	1
choose	1
from,	1
you	1
need	1
to	1
try	1
this	1
place.	1

Terrible	1
management.	1

An	1
excellent	1

Great	1

great	1
sides,	1
great	1

amazing	1
desserts.	1
1	1
Worst	1
martini	1
ever!	1
0	1
The	1
steak	1
and	1
the	1
shrimp	1
are	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
the	1
best	1
entrees	1
at	1
GC.	1
1	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
opportunity	1
today	1
to	1
sample	1
your	1
amazing	1
pizzas!	1
1	1
We	1
waited	1
for	1
thirty	1
minutes	1
to	1
be	1
seated	1
(although	1
there	1
were	1
8	1
vacant	1
tables	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
the	1
only	1
folks	1
waiting).	1

The	1
yellowtail	1
carpaccio	1
was	1
melt	1
in	1
your	1
mouth	1
fresh.	1
1	1
I	1
won't	1
try	1
going	1
back	1
there	1
even	1
if	1
it's	1
empty.	1
0	1
No,	1
I'm	1
going	1
to	1
eat	1
the	1
potato	1
that	1
I	1
found	1
some	1
strangers	1
hair	1
in	1
it.	1
0	1
Just	1
spicy	1
enough..	1
Perfect	1
actually.	1
1	1
Last	1
night	1
was	1
my	1
second	1
time	1
dining	1
here	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
happy	1
I	1
decided	1
to	1
go	1
back!	1
1	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
"hello,	1
we	1
will	1
be	1
right	1
with	1
you."	1
0	1
The	1
desserts	1
were	1
a	1
bit	1
strange.	1

My	1
boyfriend	1
and	1
I	1
came	1
here	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
on	1
a	1
recent	1
trip	1
to	1
Vegas	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
quality	1
of	1
food	1
and	1
service.	1
1	1
I	1
really	1
do	1
recommend	1
this	1
place,	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
wrong	1
with	1
this	1
donut	1
place!	1
1	1
Nice	1
ambiance.	1
1	1
I	1
would	1
recommend	1
saving	1
room	1
for	1
this!	1
1	1
I	1
guess	1
maybe	1
we	1
went	1
on	1
an	1
off	1
night	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
disgraceful.	1
0	1
However,	1
my	1
recent	1
experience	1
at	1
this	1
particular	1
location	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
good.	1
0	1
I	1
know	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
other	1
restaurants	1
at	1
all,	1
something	1
is	1
very	1
off	1
here!	1
0	1
AVOID	1
THIS	1
ESTABLISHMENT!	1
0	1
I	1
think	1
this	1
restaurant	1
suffers	1
from	1
not	1
trying	1
hard	1
enough.	1
0	1
All	1
of	1
the	1
tapas	1
dishes	1
were	1
delicious!	1
1	1
I	1
*heart*	1
this	1
place.	1
1	1
My	1
salad	1
had	1
a	1
bland	1
vinegrette	1
on	1
the	1
baby	1
greens	1
and	1
hearts	1
of	1
Palm.	1
0	1
After	1
two	1
I	1
felt	1
disgusting.	1
0	1
A	1
good	1
time!	1
1	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
this	1
place	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
stop	1
for	1
those	1
with	1
a	1
huge	1
belly	1
and	1
hankering	1
for	1
sushi.	1
1	1
Generous	1
portions	1
and	1
great	1
taste.	1
1	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
go	1
back	1

this	1
place	1
and	1
will	1
never	1
ever	1
recommended	1
this	1
place	1
to	1
anyone!	1

an	1
"Are	1

I	1
personally	1
love	1
the	1
hummus,	1
pita,	1
baklava,	1
falafels	1
and	1
Baba	1
Ganoush	1
(it's	1
amazing	1
what	1
they	1
do	1
with	1
eggplant!).	1
1	1
Very	1
convenient,	1
since	1
we	1
were	1
staying	1
at	1
the	1
MGM!	1
1	1
The	1
owners	1
are	1
super	1
friendly	1
and	1
the	1
staff	1
is	1
courteous.	1
1	1
Both	1
great!	1
1	1
Eclectic	1
selection.	1
1	1
The	1
sweet	1

tots	1
were	1
good	1
but	1
the	1
onion	1
rings	1
were	1
perfection	1
or	1
as	1
close	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
had.	1
1	1
The	1
staff	1
was	1
very	1
attentive.	1
1	1
And	1
the	1
chef	1
was	1
generous	1
with	1
his	1
time	1
(even	1
came	1
around	1
twice	1
so	1
we	1
can	1
take	1
pictures	1
with	1
him).	1
1	1
The	1
owner	1
used	1
to	1
work	1
at	1
Nobu,	1
so	1
this	1
place	1
is	1
really	1
similar	1
for	1
half	1
the	1
price.	1
1	1
Google	1
mediocre	1
and	1
I	1
imagine	1
Smashburger	1
will	1
pop	1
up.	1

dont	1
go	1
here.	1

One	1

thing	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
added	1

the	1

since	1
our	1
party	1
was	1
larger	1
than	1

I	1
thought	1
it	1

1	1
The	1

enjoy	1
the	1

our	1

from	1
the	1

was	1
FANTASTIC!	1

Main	1
thing	1
I	1
didn't	1

a	1
hot	1

that	1
looks	1
like	1
it	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
kid's	1
meal	1
at	1
the	1
Wienerschnitzel	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
idea	1

The	1

My	1

who	1
works	1
at	1
the	1
mall	1
ate	1
here	1
same	1
day,	1
and	1
guess	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
sick	1
all	1

too.	1

So	1
good	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
review	1
this	1
place	1
twice	1
-	1
once	1
hereas	1
a	1
tribute	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
once	1
as	1
a	1
tribute	1
to	1
an	1
event	1
held	1
here	1
last	1
night.	1
1	1
The	1
chips	1
and	1
salsa	1
were	1
really	1
good,	1
the	1
salsa	1
was	1
very	1
fresh.	1
1	1
This	1
place	1
is	1
great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
1	1
Mediocre	1
food.	1
0	1
Once	1
you	1
get	1
inside	1
you'll	1
be	1
impressed	1
with	1
the	1
place.	1
1	1
I'm	1
super	1
pissd.	1
0	1
And	1
service	1
was	1
super	1
friendly.	1
1	1
Why	1
are	1
these	1
sad	1
little	1
vegetables	1
so	1
overcooked?	1
0	1
This	1
place	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
nice	1
surprise!	1
1	1
They	1
were	1
golden-crispy	1
and	1
delicious.	1
1	1
I	1
had	1
high	1
hopes	1
for	1
this	1
place	1
since	1
the	1
burgers	1
are	1
cooked	1
over	1
a	1
charcoal	1
grill,	1
but	1
unfortunately	1
the	1
taste	1
fell	1
flat,	1
way	1
flat.	1
0	1
I	1
could	1
eat	1
their	1
bruschetta	1
all	1
day	1
it	1
is	1
devine.	1
1	1
Not	1
a	1
single	1
employee	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
OK	1
or	1
even	1
needed	1
a	1
water	1
refill	1
once	1
they	1
finally	1
served	1
us	1
our	1
food.	1
0	1
Lastly,	1
the	1
mozzarella	1
sticks,	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
we	1
ordered.	1
1	1
The	1
first	1
time	1
I	1
ever	1
came	1
here	1
I	1
had	1
an	1
amazing	1
experience,	1
I	1
still	1
tell	1
people	1
how	1
awesome	1
the	1
duck	1
was.	1
1	1
The	1
server	1
was	1
very	1
negligent	1
of	1
our	1
needs	1
and	1
made	1
us	1
feel	1
very	1
unwelcome...	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
suggest	1
this	1
place!	1
0	1
The	1
service	1
was	1
terrible	1
though.	1
0	1
This	1
place	1
is	1
overpriced,	1
not	1
consistent	1
with	1
their	1
boba,	1
and	1
it	1
really	1
is	1
OVERPRICED!	1
0	1
It	1
was	1
packed!!	1

I	1
love	1
this	1
place.	1
1	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
desserts	1
were	1
yummy.	1
1	1
The	1
food	1
was	1
terrible.	1
0	1
The	1
seasonal	1
fruit	1
was	1
fresh	1
white	1
peach	1
puree.	1
1	1
It	1
kept	1
getting	1
worse	1
and	1
worse	1
so	1
now	1
I'm	1
officially	1
done.	1
0	1
This	1
place	1
should	1
honestly	1
be	1
blown	1
up.	1
0	1
But	1
I	1
definitely	1
would	1
not	1
eat	1
here	1
again.	1
0	1
Do	1
not	1
waste	1
your	1
money	1
here!	1
0	1
I	1
love	1
that	1
they	1
put	1
their	1
food	1
in	1
nice	1
plastic	1
containers	1
as	1
opposed	1
to	1
cramming	1
it	1
in	1
little	1
paper	1
takeout	1
boxes.	1
1	1
The	1
crêpe	1
was	1
delicate	1
and	1
thin	1
and	1
moist.	1
1	1
Awful	1
service.	1
0	1
Won't	1
ever	1
go	1
here	1
again.	1

Food	1
quality	1
has	1
been	1
horrible.	1

For	1
that	1
price	1
I	1
can	1

of	1
a	1
few	1

I	1
would	1
have	1
much	1
rather	1
gone.	1

The	1

here	1

I	1
do	1
love	1
sushi,	1
but	1
I	1
found	1
Kabuki	1
to	1
be	1
over-priced,	1
over-hip	1
and	1
under-services.	1

Do	1
yourself	1

stay	1

Very	1
poor	1
service.	1

No	1
one	1
at	1
the	1

thought	1
the	1
food	1

above	1

worth	1
the	1
wait	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
for	1
it.	1

ever,	1
Maria	1
our	1
server	1
was	1
so	1
good	1

friendly	1
she	1
made	1
our	1
day.	1
1	1
They	1
were	1
excellent.	1
1	1
I	1
paid	1
the	1
bill	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
tip	1
because	1
I	1
felt	1
the	1
server	1
did	1
a	1
terrible	1
job.	1
0	1
Just	1
had	1
lunch	1
here	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
experience.	1
1	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
had	1
such	1
bland	1
food	1
which	1
surprised	1
me	1
considering	1
the	1
article	1
we	1
read	1
focused	1
so	1
much	1
on	1
their	1
spices	1
and	1
flavor.	1

Food	1
is	1

overpriced	1

1	1
for	1
40	1

a	1

really	1

better	1
food.	1

The	1
food	1
came	1
out	1
at	1
a	1

pace.	1
1	1
I	1
ate	1
there	1
twice	1
on	1
my	1
last	1
visit,	1
and	1
especially	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
salmon	1
salad.	1
1	1
I	1
won't	1

We	1
could	1

In	1

I'm	1
going	1
to	1
round	1
up	1
to	1
4	1
stars,	1
just	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
awesome.	1
1	1
To	1
my	1
disbelief,	1
each	1
dish	1
qualified	1
as	1
the	1
worst	1
version	1
of	1
these	1
foods	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
tasted.	1

Bad	1

or	1
not,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
low	1
tolerance	1
for	1
rude	1
customer	1
service	1
people,	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
job	1
to	1
be	1
nice	1
and	1
polite,	1
wash	1
dishes	1
otherwise!!	1

the	1
potatoes	1
were	1
great	1
and	1
so	1
was	1
the	1
biscuit.	1
1	1
I	1
probably	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
here	1
again.	1

So	1
flavorful	1
and	1
has	1
just	1
the	1
perfect	1
amount	1

The	1
price	1
is	1
reasonable	1

the	1
service	1
is	1
great.	1
1	1
The	1
Wife	1
hated	1
her	1
meal	1
(coconut	1
shrimp),	1
and	1
our	1
friends	1
really	1
did	1
not	1
enjoy	1
their	1
meals,	1
either.	1

My	1
fella	1
got	1
the	1
huevos	1
rancheros	1

they	1
didn't	1
look	1
too	1
appealing.	1

Went	1
in	1

happy	1
hour,	1
great	1

1	1
Some	1
may	1
say	1
this	1
buffet	1
is	1
pricey	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
get	1
what	1
you	1
pay	1
for	1
and	1
this	1
place	1
you	1
are	1
getting	1
quite	1
a	1

more	1

the	1
biggest	1
fail	1
of	1
the	1
entire	1
trip	1
for	1
us.	1
0	1
Needless	1
to	1
say,	1
I	1
won't	1
be	1
going	1
back	1
anytime	1
soon.	1

This	1
place	1
is	1
disgusting!	1

Every	1
time	1
I	1
eat	1
here,	1
I	1
see	1
caring	1
teamwork	1
to	1
a	1
professional	1
degree.	1
1	1
The	1
RI	1
style	1
calamari	1
was	1
a	1
joke.	1
0	1
However,	1
there	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
garlic	1
in	1
the	1
fondue,	1
it	1
was	1
barely	1
edible.	1
0	1
I	1
could	1
barely	1
stomach	1
the	1
meal,	1
but	1
didn't	1
complain	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
business	1
lunch.	1
0	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
bad,	1
I	1
had	1
lost	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
finish	1
it.	1
0	1
It	1
also	1
took	1
her	1
forever	1
to	1
bring	1
us	1
the	1
check	1
when	1
we	1
asked	1
for	1
it.	1
0	1
We	1
aren't	1
ones	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
scene	1
at	1
restaurants	1
but	1
I	1
just	1
don't	1
get	1
it...definitely	1
lost	1
the	1
love	1
after	1
this	1
one!	1
0	1
Disappointing	1
experience.	1
0	1
The	1
food	1
is	1
about	1
on	1
par	1
with	1
Denny's,	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
not	1
good	1
at	1
all.	1

If	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
mediocre	1
food	1
and	1
downright	1
terrible	1
service,	1
then	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
for	1
you.	1

WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy	1
over	1

all	1
I	1
am	1

We	1

going	1
back.	1

The	1
place	1
was	1
fairly	1
clean	1
but	1
the	1
food	1
simply	1
wasn't	1
worth	1
it.	1
0	1
This	1
place	1
lacked	1
style!!	1
0	1
The	1
sangria	1
was	1
about	1
half	1
of	1
a	1
glass	1
wine	1
full	1
and	1
was	1
$12,	1
ridiculous.	1
0	1
Don't	1
bother	1
coming	1
here.	1

The	1
meat	1
was	1
pretty	1
dry,	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
sliced	1
brisket	1
and	1
pulled	1
pork.	1

The	1
building	1
itself	1
seems	1
pretty	1
neat;	1
the	1
bathroom	1
is	1
pretty	1
trippy,	1
but	1
I	1
wouldn't	1
eat	1
here	1
again.	1
0	1
It	1
was	1
equally	1
awful.	1
0	1
Probably	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
go	1
back.	1
0	1
very	1
slow	1
at	1
seating	1
even	1
with	1
reservation.	1

Not	1
good	1
by	1
any	1
stretch	1
of	1
the	1
imagination.	1

The	1
cashew	1
cream	1
sauce	1
was	1
bland	1
and	1
the	1
vegetables	1
were	1
undercooked.	1
0	1
The	1
chipolte	1
ranch	1
dipping	1
sause	1
was	1
tasteless,	1
seemed	1
thin	1
and	1
watered	1
down	1
with	1
no	1
heat.	1
0	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
bit	1
too	1
sweet,	1
not	1
really	1
spicy	1
enough,	1
and	1
lacked	1
flavor.	1
0	1
I	1
was	1
VERY	1
disappointed!!	1
0	1
This	1
place	1
is	1
horrible	1
and	1
way	1
overpriced.	1
0	1
Maybe	1
it's	1
just	1
their	1
Vegetarian	1
fare,	1
but	1
I've	1
been	1
twice	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
average	1
at	1
best.	1
0	1
It	1
wasn't	1
busy	1
at	1
all	1
and	1
now	1
we	1
know	1
why.	1
0	1
The	1
tables	1
outside	1
are	1
also	1
dirty	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
the	1
workers	1
are	1
not	1
always	1
friendly	1
and	1
helpful	1
with	1
the	1
menu.	1

The	1
ambiance	1
here	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
like	1
a	1
buffet	1
setting,	1
but	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
douchey	1
indoor	1
garden	1
for	1
tea	1
and	1
biscuits.	1

Con:	1
spotty	1
service.	1

The	1

were	1
not	1

then	1
they	1
came	1
back	1
cold.	1

Then	1
our	1
food	1
came	1
out,	1
disappointment	1
ensued.	1

The	1
real	1
disappointment	1
was	1
our	1
waiter.	1

My	1
husband	1
said	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
rude...	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
apologize	1
for	1
the	1
bad	1
food	1
or	1
anything.	1
0	1
The	1
only	1
reason	1
to	1
eat	1
here	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
fill	1
up	1
before	1
a	1
night	1
of	1
binge	1
drinking	1
just	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
carbs	1
in	1
your	1
stomach.	1
0	1
Insults,	1
profound	1
deuchebaggery,	1
and	1
had	1
to	1
go	1
outside	1
for	1
a	1
smoke	1
break	1
while	1
serving	1
just	1
to	1
solidify	1
it.	1

If	1
someone	1
orders	1
two	1
tacos	1
don't'	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
part	1
of	1
customer	1
service	1
to	1
ask	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
combo	1
or	1
ala	1
cart?	1

She	1
was	1
quite	1
disappointed	1
although	1
some	1
blame	1
needs	1
to	1
be	1
placed	1
at	1
her	1
door.	1

After	1
all	1
the	1
rave	1
reviews	1
I	1
couldn't	1
wait	1
to	1
eat	1
here......what	1
a	1
disappointment!	1

Del	1

like	1
it.	1

Hell	1

We've	1
have	1
gotten	1
a	1
much	1
better	1
service	1
from	1
the	1

the	1
services	1
we	1

I	1
don't	1

about	1
this	1

I	1
won't	1

back	1
"ya'all".	1

I	1
immediately	1
said	1
I	1
wanted	1

talk	1

I	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
talk	1

was	1
doing	1
shots	1

too	1
bad	1
cause	1
I	1

it's	1
family	1

I	1
really	1
wanted	1

like	1
this	1

I	1
vomited	1
in	1

mid	1

I	1
kept	1
looking	1

it	1

35	1
minutes,	1

still	1
no	1
food.	1

I	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
very	1
few	1
places	1
to	1
eat	1
that	1
under	1
no	1

would	1
I	1
ever	1
return	1
to,	1

this	1
tops	1
the	1
list.	1

We	1
started	1
with	1
the	1
tuna	1
sashimi	1
which	1
was	1
brownish	1

color	1

obviously	1
wasn't	1
fresh.	1

Food	1
was	1
below	1
average.	1

It	1
sure	1
does	1
beat	1
the	1
nachos	1

I	1
would	1
expect	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
more	1
coming	1
from	1
a	1
restaurant.	1

All	1
in	1
all,	1
Ha	1

a	1

a	1
flop.	1

The	1
problem	1
I	1
have	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
charge	1
$11.99	1
for	1
a	1
sandwich	1
that	1
is	1
no	1
bigger	1
than	1
a	1
Subway	1
sub	1
(which	1
offers	1
better	1
and	1
more	1
amount	1
of	1
vegetables).	1

Shrimp-	1
When	1
I	1
unwrapped	1
it	1
(I	1
live	1
only	1
1/2	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
Brushfire)	1
it	1
was	1
literally	1
ice	1
cold.	1

It	1
lacked	1
flavor,	1
seemed	1
undercooked,	1

dry.	1

It	1
really	1
is	1
impressive	1
that	1
the	1
place	1
hasn't	1
closed	1
down.	1

The	1
refried	1
beans	1
that	1
came	1
with	1
