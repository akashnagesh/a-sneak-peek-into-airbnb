The room was nice, all place was clean. Islam managed pretty well our arrival, even if it was last minute ;) i do recommand this place to any airbnb user :)"1178162	4869189	41423	6452964	Charlotte	Great location for both airport and city - great amenities in the house: Plus Islam was always very helpful even though he was away1178162	5003196	41431	6449554	Sebastian	We really enjoyed our stay at Islams house. From the outside the house didn't look so inviting but the inside was very nice! Even though Islam himself was not there everything was prepared for our arrival. The airport T Station is only a 5-10 min walk away. The only little issue was that all the people in the house had to share one bathroom. But it was not really a problem and it worked out fine. We would recommend Islams place for a stay in Boston. 1178162	5150351	41440	2215611	Marine	The room was nice and clean and so were the commodities. Very close to the airport metro station and located in quite safe area. Islam responds very quickly and is very helpful. I would recommend it. 1178162	5171140	41441	6848427	Andrew	"Great location. Just 5 mins walk from the Airport Station. Good food nearby.Room was simple, clean, just what I was after."1178162	5198929	41442	6663826	Arndt	"A truely exeptional place to stay. The hosts are amazingly friendly, the rooms are spotless, and there is WiFi.The location is superb: A Latin-American neighborhood close to the airport and just a few subway rides away from downtown. Highly recommened!"1178162	6702817	41507	8099222	Maurice	It was a really nice time in Boston - best place to stay over in Boston !! Really nice and helpful hosts - taking there time to explain all the good things to see and how to come there.We had a really nice time in Boston and they had a big part on that.If you want to go out doing sth - just ask them and they may come with you.Really nice and clean house - near to the airport and the subway station ( like 6 minutes away ). We had a really good time there and can just recommend it to anyone who want to have a comfortable and enjoyable place to stay in Boston for a good price. Thanks a lot.1178162	6873023	41514	7671888	Elodie	"Islam is a very nice guy ! Attentive, funny, he gave me recommandation and info about boston ( nightlife, places to go and so on) His flat is clean, tidy and there is a patio which is a real plus! I DO recommand this, great experience !"1178162	7646702	41545	8197342	Arkadiusz	"The place is really well furnished, pleasant and clean. Islam was very helpful, you can feel free to ask him virtually anything and he'll help you. He was fun too, very cool talking to him. Oh, and the place is pretty conveniently located too. Highly recommended.The neighbourhood might not be the cleanest in Boston (my gf liked Brooklyne much more in that matter), but this is a great location and price for value overall."1178162	8094418	41562	9040491	Matthew	Our stay at Islam's place was fantastic. We couldn't have asked for a better value on location and amenities. We felt very much at home and comfortable at his place and would be quick to stay with him again if we return to Boston!Islam was always quick to respond to any questions or concerns we had and very accommodating at every point in our trip! Truly a wonderful place and a lovely host!1178162	8174594	41566	9101576	Simona	"Our stay at Islam's was very enjoyable, Islam is a very kind and responsive host.The room was clean and comfortable and the house is provided with all comforts: full kitchen, satellite TV, comfortable living room, excellent WIFI connection in all areas.It is extremely conveniently located to downtown Boston (a few metro stops) and walking distance to the free shuttles connecting to the airport. "1178162	8226316	41568	884407	Laurent	"Communication with Islam and his brother was good. However, we arrived at their house and the toilet was completely plugged up and full of excrements. At this point, we were totally disgusted. We went out to town, which by train takes about 15mn plus 10mn walk to the station. We managed to speak with Islam brother. He fixed the problem when we came back by 4pm. The house is basic with thin walls and the bedrooms are minimum comfort. We were supposed to be on the basement, which I really don't recommend. Bad smell and the bed is for one person rather than two. We stayed in the upper room, as we though we were there. Nobody in the house except from one guest staying also in the upper level. Islam sent us an email during our stay, which we couldn't see as we didn't have a computer with us or the use of our smartphone. However, he told us to stay in the basement while no booking was made for the upper room. Not sure why he wanted us to stay in the basement where the room and bed were very basic, when he could have told us to stay in the room upstairs!The fact that the owner wasn't there made it a strange feeling. The back door in the kitchen were not locked at all, while our luggage was in the house. We didn't got told at all. We had to put a bar across to kinda off close the sliding door but felt very unsafe as anybody could have walking in easily or made their way in.All in all, things went fine by the end but we definitely not recommend the place unless the owner is there. If you are looking for a cheap place to stay and don't mind of those inconvenience, then you will like it.A part from that Boston is a great city and we had fun!"1178162	8372308	41575	8837991	Olga Maria	"Mi estad�_a en Boston aunque corta fue muy buena, la habitaci�_n excelente, muy limpia y ordenada, no tuve ning̼n inconveniente dentro de la casa. Si vuelvo a Boston volver̩ a buscarlos. Gracias!! "1178162	8414572	41576	478275	Kat	"Well sized room for two people with the basic necessities which also included a mini fridge. Our room, the common areas and bathrooms were clean when we arrived. There were good kitchen facilities but we did not have to use them. Overall good value for a location that is close enough to downtown Boston. "1178162	8523707	41582	8824032	Ivan	"GREAT SPACE, PERFECT LOCATION, AWESOME PEOPLE!! Definately will be back!!!! "1178162	11069185	41716	10454265	Jeffrey	"The room was exactly as pictured, no frills, yet adequate for my needs. The street parking was nearly impossible to find,  but you can't expect much better in Boston. I'd recommend this room to others..."1178162	11159232	41721	9798322	Alexander	The room was clean and very comfortable. Having a key for this room also made it very safe. Getting to downtown is also very easy and fast. The whole is also very nice from the inside offering everything needed. I would definetly come back!1178162	11420562	41730	6097987	Karthikram	Izzy was great... had clear instructions and no problems entering the house... the neighborhood wasn't great though.1178162	11696317	41741	13599868	Paola	"The place was really good, it is like 10 minutes from the airport so it was  perfect for me because i had a connection flight, the taxi will cost u max 15 dolars and if you go by shuttle is free, the house is very clean and the room was very confortable. The only thing is that i arrive and the owner wasnt there and i didnt read the instructions where he told me how to get in the house so i was waiting for about an hour, but if you read the instructions everything will be fine."1178162	11766427	41743	5064941	Joe	"The host wasn't there, but it was fine. He left clear instructions, and we spent 2 good nights there. It was a room was in a shared house, where there happened to be some interesting people staying, so we got to chat with some awesome people. The neighborhood is ok, had some good Colombian food."1178162	11901870	41747	578962	Samir	Izzy was a nice and helpful host with detailed directions. The room is in the basement and even though Izzy mentions it we somehow missed that detail and it has narrow stairs leading down to it which made it hard for us to carry our bags up and down. We are unfortunately traveling with really heavy bags. The place is in East Boston and is extremely convenient for the airport.1178162	12116711	41752	5051049	Oliver	"We arrived late from the airport, so the location was very convenient, just a 5 min walk from the airport T station. Check-in was quick and easy and the room as described. It's also very close to downtown Boston. We had a perfect stay and would definitely stay there again."1178162	12168229	41753	14421460	Ron	"Izzy was quick to reply to our request, and provided thorough instructions related to finding and entering the home. We loved the convenience of the location near the airport, as we weren't familiar with Boston, and landed late at night, so we didn't want to have to travel far or follow complicated directions to find the place. Although we never had any face-to-face contact with Izzy or anyone else in the home during our brief overnight stay, we felt comfortable there. Although we were assured that the neighborhood was safe, we were still feeling a bit on edge walking late at night from the Airport ""T"" station. Nonetheless, we made our way there without incident, and had a restful night of sleep before launching out the next day. Thanks, Izzy!"1178162	12243132	41756	10018866	Crystal	Everything is exactly as posted! super convenient + easy to find.1178162	12753057	41769	14113353	Chris	We didn�t meet Izzy at all!!!! After we arrived nobody was there except some spanish speaking people.Our room was disgusting!!! It smelted like mold and was very dirty!!!!The Bathroom wasn�t cleaned either and my friend and i wanted to leave right after we came��_The Dryer or washer was not usable because the assistant from Izzy washed all the time.The Neighborhood is not safe at all and every other morning u could hear people fight.Don�t stay there!!!!!! It�s nothing like u would expect it! And it�s defenetly to expensive for this nasty place!!!! 1178162	13186169	41780	14192408	Alex	I didn't get a chance to meet Izzy but I thought the system that was set up was really well done. Things went quite smoothly upon arrival as per the detailed instructions that were left. We managed to get the key from the lock box easily which was nice because it provided flexibility for whatever time we arrived. This place is extremely close to the airport. I've never stayed next door to the airport before. Less than a 5 min ride to Airport Station which was then a 5 min walk.Place had everything. Felt very homely like staying at a friends. Location was amazing!! East Boston has some hidden gem restaurants and proximity to Airport subway station was key. No complaints about the room or bathroom.Great setup Izzy!1178162	13514415	41788	14007556	��sk	"Izzy's assistant was a nice and helpful person. We stayed 7 days, kitchen had everything one needs to make good food even a mixer! Our room was in the cellar and therefore very private. One fight next door where we heard screaming and shouting but overall a very calm neighbourhood and friendly people."1178162	13586652	41790	419353	Phillip	"Host wasn't there, but instructions were clear to find and get in the place. Convenient location and a decent neighborhood (safe but a bit run-down and not much around). The room was basic but had everything I needed."1178162	13801287	41794	1636024	Fukuko	Izzy's place was very convenient for getting to the airport. The room was cosy and clean. I was impressed with the tea selections. Izzy's friend was helpful and friendly. Definitely will come back when we have to fly out from Boston again!  1178162	14000401	41799	16307906	Amber	"Well we were kind of annoyed to be honest. We chose the most expensive room in the house because we were meant to be the only ones on the bottom floor, and we were told we would get a computer...Well we had his assistant sleep right outside our door and we did not have a computer. On top of that, every room had a TV but ours, and the tv in the living room did not get basic channels which frustrated us. The house was a mess up until the day we left, because izzy was apparently coming home that day, so his assistant decided to clean up. It was a totally different house upon checkout. His assistant was lovely, just not much help...As far as The location goes, it is convenient to downtown and the airport, and has local shops and restaurants close by. We did enjoy our stay overall there was just more than enough frustrating elements.."1178162	14849457	41817	17001205	Sarah	"We never met our host, but they were willing to book the room with little notice.  The room was clean.There's a little cafe a few blocks up the street that made for a perfect breakfast.We didn't realize that other people would be staying too, so when they came it was a little spooky until we met them."1178162	14934841	41819	16598717	New	"It was a great place to stay. Quiet, clean and close to shops, airport and public transportation.  Would recommend and stay here again."1178162	15125674	41822	13007001	Ali	"Overall a pleasing experience.  We flew into Boston for one night to go to a concert.  Izzy left straight forward and easy to read instructions on how to reach the flat, and enter.  The room was as pictured, and exactly what we needed for the night. Izzy was readily available to us by phone or text whenever we had any questions. The flat is really close to the airport, and only a small hop into the heart of Boston, it was very convenient for us! :)"1178162	15430473	41828	13616703	Cyril	"Boston is one of the best city's I have ever been.Issy's place is good located, and nice. I would recommend this place for everybody!"1178162	15648106	41833	17376849	Emily	Clear directions.  Good neighborhood. Close to t station. Clean room. Quiet. Perfect!1178162	15728913	41834	11524242	Mika	The host actually gave us a place to sleep. It is really simple. Very close to subway was perfect. There have several problems the host needs to improve. 1178162	15846810	41836	17826223	Raija	"OK stay.  Perhaps best for those on the young/adventurous side of the spectrum!  There was a sign that said 'in the process of renovations'.   I think the second floor might be a little noisy some evenings, with 3 rooms up there. The one lower/ground floor room was quieter, but keep in mind not easily accessible with narrow winding stairs. Futon style bed.     The host was prompt with text message responses to questions about parking.  Parking in the neighborhood mid-day was easy but all streets were filled with parked/double parked cars by 5pm.  It was a fairly short walk to the Blue line train line - Airport station. "1178162	15895093	41837	18020631	Lucas	"Izzy was very helpful with directions and he was easy to get in touch with, as I had some questions.  This is a great location that is a short walk to the airport shuttle.  The room is in the basement and it gets hot during the day.  The house has A/C upstairs, but this does not reach the basement room so it was pretty hot.  The neighborhood a little bit ethnic, which I didn't mind, but if this makes you uncomfortable you might want to look elsewhere.  I felt safe, and the lockbox system is secure.  For a traveler like myself who had an early flight out of Logan, this was the cost effective option.  Can't beat the price for a location so close to the airport!"1178162	15982012	41839	7543714	Anne-Marie	This was ok it was easy with clear information on how getting in the house and it was very safe. The host wasn't there during the stay. The neighborhood is not so nice to hang out at night.1178162	16035159	41840	17287987	Shu-Ping	"Izzy was out of the town when I stayed there. The location is very close to the airport, and the neighborhood is quiet and friendly.  I enjoyed my stay there and made a reservation for an additional night. "1178162	16221436	41843	2420725	Jessica	"Unfortunately, we can't agree with the many positive reviews. The house was easy to find and just a short 7 minute walk from the T-Station ""Airport"", but not what I would describe as clean. After arrival I started to clean a bit. E.g. the hob in the spacious kitchen, which you can use including all the inventory(and what's perfect for a nice breakfast), was kind of greasy and that didn't change during our three day stay. Sure this isn't a hotel and the guests are responsible for cleanliness as well, but the host takes a cleaning fee. If they would clean the house on a regular basis, it would be a nice accommodation, as we really liked the premises. Our basement room had a little fridge, a mirror, a tv and a luggage stand what we appreciated. Somehow we missed the ""warm welcome"" feeling  we experienced at other airbnb locations. "1178162	16730352	41852	7012629	Claudia	"East Boston is very nice place, well connected to the whole city and all services needed at walking distance. The house is exactly as described, very easy to find and check in, lots of common space and nice environment. Izzy does not living in, but it's not a problem at all! He's very helpful and answered immediately to every need we had.The house is clean, not so much the room in the basement."1178162	16789257	41853	17832793	Lydia	"We arrived late and left early in the morning but everything was good. Easy to find, good instructions,  comfortable bed."1178162	17176912	41859	857238	Tim & Charlie	Izzy's room is a great value for an airport related stay. The convenience to the airport is even better than it seems in the description. The room was clean as were sheets and towels. The room could have benefitted from AC because it was August but Izzy gave us a powerful and quiet fan so we were okay.1178162	18437695	41877	2789022	Gianluca	Had a good experience overall. Short and sweet. 1178162	18561737	41879	19310647	Tamas	"It was a pleasant stay although we didn't meet personally. The room was comfortable, the metro station is close and it is really fast to get into Boston so al together we had a great time there."1178162	18696958	41881	15346724	Stephen	Izzy's home is conveniently located for anyone visiting Boston and we were made to feel very at home. The neighborhood appears sketchy and was uncomfortable to walk through at night. Still an overall positive experience.1178162	19087737	41888	13609481	Sarah	"Izzy's listing was as described, the room was perfect for our short stay at Boston. Although we never got to meet izzy, his brother made us feel more than welcome and helped us with anything we needed. The location was also good for us, only a few minutes from the tracks which took us straight in to Boston. "1178162	19282278	41891	20036237	Chris	"It has a quiet, convenient and safe environment.I really enjoy the stay and the talking with our host who is very nice and helpful. "1178162	19617260	41897	20104957	Nora	"We had a great Time in Boston! We really enjoyed our stay at Izzys Place. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. There is only one bathroom in the house, but some how the bath wasnt usually blocked. We never had to wait long. You only Need About 5 Minutes to the t-station and only 3 Station to downtown, which was very nice. We can recommend izzys Place - thank for everything.

Very short walk to the airport shuttle. Great restaurants in the area. (Try the Bandeja Paisa at El Penol A few mix ups due to my last-minute booking, but everything was made right very quickly. Great customer service. Not the fanciest place in the world, but perfect for the budget traveler.Since other rooms in the home are also rented out through Airbnb, got to meet some other interesting travelers. "1178162	20150373	41906	20418512	Emilian	"The house was very easy to find (although it was my first time in the US and Boston) and really within walking distance of the airport. Everything was exactly as described, and we did not experience any problems during our stay (short as it was). We got a clean room with a comfortable bed, and the bathroom was also nice. If I have to stay in Boston for the night again and get back to the airport real quick, Izzy's house would be my first choice."1178162	20239559	41908	20263502	Ilir	"I didn't meet Izzy, but his roommate was very nice and helpful.The room is in a very good condition, clean and you have enough space.

Dat betekent dat wij tijdens ons verblijf Izzy niet hebben ontmoet. Het systeem werkte prima. De kamer was zoals op de foto, alleen het bed stond nu haaks op de muur. Het huis bevindt zich in een Latijns-Amerikaanse buurt en is makkelijk te bereiken vanaf het metrostation Airport. Je bent binnen een paar haltes in het centrum van Boston. Het enige minpunt aan de locatie is dat je altijd de metro moet gebruiken en niet naar het centrum kan lopen.

Would definitely recommend it to anyone coming to Boston. 1178162	21219502	41925	1822593	Alexa	"The house was in a very convenient location to the airport (we walked to the shuttle) and the bed/room was clean. Not a great neighborhood, but again it was booked to be close to our early morning flight."1178162	21303347	41926	21630508	Linda	"Hard tofind parking.  One night's sleep is alright.  We didn't get to use the one only bathroom, which is shared by all.  There are 4 rooms with a total of 8 people, so it's like sharing one bathroom with 8 people."1178162	21396968	41928	9897678	Charissa	"Izzy's place is the perfect location for those leaving to and from Logan airport, really short walking distance and a few subway stops to downtown Boston. We had a nice stay at Izzy's. The room was clean and Izzy provided a very detailed instruction of how to get to the house and everything we might need. If there's any downside I can think of is that there's only one washroom in the house and sometimes there's a wait time to use it due to the many other guests that stayed in the house. Overall, we barely have any issues and enjoyed our vacation at Izzy's place. Cheers! "1178162	21443603	41929	22285554	Stella	"Staying at Izzy's was very convenient, especially because we had had all the information needed prior to our stay. The place was exactly as pictured. To me its location was definitely the winner, access to airport and subway was really easy. On top of that, the house was clean and well taken care of. Despite being situated in the basement, the room was also very nice and quite spacious. I liked how we had enough shelving to put our things. The only thing I wished to be different was that there was only one bathroom for all guests to share. "1178162	21721762	41934	1176690	Yanev	The room was as advertised.  It was comfortable and clean.

Would highly recommend to anyone."1178162	22437993	41949	14291246	Juliet	"Izzy's place is perfect! My friend and I really enjoyed our stay! Our room is located on the first floor of the house, and is very spacious and clean. The living room, kitchen and bathroom are all clean, spacious and cozy. Izzy offered various tea bags, coffee, chocolate, fruit, bread etc. which is very nice. This place really feels like home. Izzy's really warm and kind. He helped us carry luggage to our room and opened mistakenly closed room door early in the morning. The Italian seafood place he recommended, Rino's, is beyond delicious! We ordered some mussels and lobster ravioli. And, it's only one block away!Overall, our stay in Izzy's place is lovely. It's close to transport station, which has shuttle buses that take you to the airport for only about 15 minutes and subways to the downtown area. I'll definitely recommend this place to my friends!"1178162	22596124	41953	22315941	Leo	"I was occupied during the day and only made it home around 11PM each night so I did not have a chance to meet the host. Nevertheless, the house was clean, and the room was spacious. In addition, I think the best thing about this place is the fact that the location was really convenient, about 6 minutes of walk along large street after getting off of the subway station (which also has free shuttles to airport). "1178162	22726247	41955	14497808	Sara	"The place was perfectly located for my airport transit and so easy to get to, especially with the detailed instructions that were provided by Izzy.  The house is in cool neighbourhood and there is an excellent Mexican spot right around the corner (Angela's cafe).  All amenities I needed were provided.  The room had a controllable heater, so I could adjust the temperature myself.Izzy is an awesome, cool host, who takes a genuine interest in his guests.

We had everything we needed."1178162	22999630	41962	23776363	Michael	We had a good experience.  Very short in and out but it was great to be next to the airport.  Thanks1178162	23050299	41964	22096304	Mike	"Absolutely no complaints about my stay. Very easy to access from the airport (walking) with great instructions that Izzy sent beforehand. Only met Izzy's brother. He was great, friendly and welcoming. The room had everything it needed to have. I was given a key to lock the room while I was gone during the day. Would highly recommend staying here!"1178162	23260679	41969	19593921	Juan	"We didn't get to meet Izzy, but the room was very nice and the location was good! Would love to come back."1178162	23315686	41971	14847580	Srinivas Spurthi	"I had to catch an early morning flight and needed a place to crash for one short night. This place was perfect as it was close to the airport (short walk to the airport shuttle stop). I did not get to meet Izzy but his brother was a good host. The room in the basement was clean, comfortable, warm and quiet. Highly recommended for convenience of airport access."1178162	23351500	41972	14641493	Aiganym	"The room we stayed in was very clean and nicely appointed. Unfortunately I didn't meet the host, but I liked the idea of how it was managed. I would recommend to stay there and would definitely stay there the next time I'm around Boston. "1178162	23450946	41974	10350277	Pedro Jorge	It was a really good time there. The host was really friendly and helpful. Definitely a good place to stay during a trip to Boston.  1178162	23670238	41980	24350972	Kaley	The place was great! I stayed earlier in the week and returned again on my return to Boston because the people are easy going and the place is cozy and quiet for getting work done.1178162	23853703	41985	4832845	Gg	It was perfect room for my business trip. I believe that Izzy chose that room for me as he considered the nature of my trip. It was very quiet as it was separate from other areas. I could rest well every night. The room temperature was perfect for my comfortable stay. The house was well-maintained and very clean. I strongly felt that it was a home away from home in that sense. Rosie was very nice. She baked a nice breadless cake for all of us with yogurt frosting and chocolate chips on top. I would love to stay at Izzy's again and again if I have more business trips to the area in the future. Thank you Izzy!1178162	24089682	41992	24635135	Yun	"It's a great place to stay. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. The house is only 10-15 minutes away from the metro station. The room is spacious, clean  and comfortable. The bathroom is clean and big too. We can use kitchen freely. The whole experience is great. We will definitely stay there again next time when we visit Boston."1178162	24442199	42001	15838913	Michelle	Room was exactly what listing posted. Had no problem finding location and host was very accommodating though we never formally met. Room even had a little heater and it was perfect for my stay. I would stay here again.1178162	24557473	42003	22551779	Hariharan	Good private accommodation. The room was exactly as mentioned.  Would highly recommend it.1178162	25051451	42009	24947394	Anna	"Una casa muy acogedora, muy cerca (a menos de 10 minutos andando) de la parada de metro donde se coge el bus shuttle (gratis, por cierto) que va al aeropuerto.

It was very easy to find the place and it was also very simple to check in and get situated. Overall, it was a very nice stay and I plan on staying here whenever I come to Boston"1178162	26147544	42039	5337984	Javier	"Even though I never got to meet Izzy, the whole experience was great. The room is spacious, clean and cozy and exactly as mentioned. Had no problem finding location. Overall, it was a really nice stay. Thanks :) "1178162	26173195	42040	8479064	Iyann	"I had to book a last minute stay the day before and Izzy was really nice to give me immediate and fast response. He assured me I have that room although I had technical problems with Airbnb, again. Izzy was always responsive throughout my stay, though I didn't get to see him. I went there the day after the snow storm. Arrived at South Station. (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) taught me to walk 15 mins to the blue T line. But I took the silver line and then the free airport shuttle. It was actually better option considering my heavy luggage. I arrived the day after the snow storm. The distance from the airport subway station to the apartment wasn't far, but the excessive snow made it really difficult to walk. The pathways were narrow n the steps were hard to climb with my luggage. But by evening, it was nice that the snow were shoveled from the steps. I personally like the place a lot - homey and comfy and has everything I need. It's easy and fast to get to the airport n main attractions too."1178162	26512707	42049	21650503	Alexandra	We stayed with Izzy just for one night because it was close to Logan airport and I had a flight the next morning. He was really nice and the room was warm and comfy! Good location with parking. I would definitely recommend staying here!1178162	26913566	42057	24332659	Erika	"Izzy is a great host. He helped us with the luggage and was ready to answer us with any questions we may have had. He was in the house the whole week and he gave us plenty of privacy. We could use for free washer and dryer and the kitchen was always available. We had some trouble finding a car park because of the snow so we had to park 10-minute walk away from our street, anyway was also nice to hang out with the other airbnb guests and share cultures :) The bathroom was always available and also you could use towels and everything was clean. We could t really go around the neighbourhood but we were close to a cvs pharmacy, a grocery shop and the blue line station (airport stop).I would definitely stay there again!!!"1178162	27367271	42065	17005346	Anthony	"Nice place, great location! Neighborhood is great, many local restaurants, caf̩s, etc. Close to downtown, 5-10 mins. Izzy has been a great host; welcoming and present to help his guests! We had an amazing time!"1178162	27421477	42066	28563664	Doug	"The place was right on, no surprises. Izzy was a nice guy, pretty laid back. The house was close to the subway, but the 5 blocks between the two would be a little unnerving to walk at night."1178162	27724234	42073	8111051	Greg	"Izzy was a gracious and generous host.  He was flexible with check-in and accommodating with all facets of our stay.  He even was able to help some other travelers who'd had a bad experience with another AirBNB host.  solid guy.One detail to be aware of - there is only one bathroom shared amongst numerous guests.  If you're ok with a little bathroom sharing and potentially waiting in line, this is a perfectly fine place to stay."1178162	27820897	42075	12823489	Jan	"Although we planned this trip to Boston quite spontaneous, we did not have any issues with finding an accommodation at Iyyz Jm's place. The direction from the public transportation were very straight forward and explained everything very well. Once we arrived at the place, we fount very clean, well-decorated, and welcoming rooms. A personal welcome note further helped us considering this place as our new home for two days. We shared the entire house with two other airbnb'ers, which were really nice and polite as well. Overall, I'm very happy I've fount this place and can certainly recommend it to everyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune for the hotels downtown!"1178162	28194318	42082	13534991	Pragya	"It was a great location, very close to the airport and easy to find. The apartment was well-furnished. The room was clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was shared with other guests. Excellent stay! Highly recommend this listing!"1178162	28275938	42084	28940110	Sophie	"I did a self check-in which went very smoothly as Izzy's detailed directions were very easy to follow. The house was very close to Airport Station, and the neighborhood was fine. Kitchen and livingroom were beautiful, my room in the basement was simple, clean, and comfortable. There was even a small space heater to keep me warm during the night. Everything was well-organized and welcoming. The other guests were very nice as well. I would definitely stay here again!"1178162	28832314	42093	29541165	Emily	Everything was great--izzy was very detailed in his instructions and it was an easy stay!1178162	28918872	42094	16005330	Michael	"The place was as advertized - a private room, great price, close to the airport, etc. And while I am reluctant to give negative feedback I felt that Izzi is running an operation here that is not consistent with my values, and what I believe are the implicit values of the AirBnB ""community.""The host actually does not live in the place, rather he lives out of state and has some caretaker changing the sheets and keeping the place clean. So in essence the place is a low security hotel or hostel - except with no management present to deal with any contingencies that might come up between guests. Given that there is shared intimate space the proprietor is relying on the generally good character of the ""AirBnB Community"" to make sure that nothing untoward occurs. Chances are that nothing untoward will occur, but it is an exposure.What I also feel is happening in this sort of operation is that it is a business being run in a residential area - compromising the coherency of the neighborhood and riding on the infrastructure of legitimate hotels  (who pay hotel taxes, liability insurance, employment taxes, and other commercial fees) while not paying for the infrastructure that these taxes and fees pay for.This is America, where entrepreneurial enterprise is rewarded. But this is also America where this can mean concentrating enterprise efforts on profit centers, and externalizing cost centers. The impacts of that externalization do not decrease the costs, they just end up in someone else in-basket.  My sense of conviviality eschews externalizing costs to the expense of the neighborhood or local businesses."1178162	29075057	42097	4136165	Andrew	The space is nice enough and it's *great* value. I wouldn't say that the way that the host welcomed me was especially warm and friendly -- there was a form message that instructed me on how to get into the apartment. I think the message could be more personalized.1178162	29113877	42098	28415206	Dan�_el	"It was very nice, everything was fine and comfy, even though the host didnt stay at all in the house (no big deal)"1178162	29343569	42100	25521189	Jeannette	"Great location for the airport - however we couldn't go through the park as the gate was locked, which made getting to the airport for our early morning flight a little stressful. Otherwise - great room, great location and great price!"1178162	29713671	42105	30822621	Jordan	"Close to the airport, affordable, hardly knew i was in someones house it was so quiet. Can't really ask for more for your stopover in Boston. Make sure you leave with plenty of time to go North of the East Boston Memorial Park if your flight is in the early morning as the gates will be chained. Going up the greenbelt trail i was able to make it to the T station in plenty of time."1178162	29773639	42106	10822797	Jessica	"Izzy's place was extremely convenient fir us since it's so clise to the airport and just twi subway stops away from downtown. we loved to see the ""real"" Boston in a cool, safe neighborhood, and also loved some of the restaurants nearby. Although we didn't get to meet Izzy, he was very accomodating to our needs. Would definitely recommend fir anyone looking for good value in Boston."1178162	30113234	42111	1277291	Albert	Izzy's communication is very good. All communication was done via text or AirBnB messaging. Directions and house details were well spelled out & clear. I was in the basement room of the 3 rooms he rents out. Everything is clean but spares. I would not consider it cozy but it was a very good value. 1178162	30375840	42115	17044595	Carolyn	"I did not see Izzy during my stay, but the check-in instructions delivered by email were very clear. The home is run much like a hostel - I was welcomed by a white-board on the door of my room.  Everyone else staying in the house was very nice and helped me feel at home. There are shared tea/coffee supplies, slippers, and a space heater for my room, all of which were nice touches! The neighborhood is Mexican-American, with many ethnic food choices. There was no great place for groceries or coffee, but Santarpio's pizza is the best in Boston and is within walking distance of the house (cash only - worth every penny!) The Government Center Station on the T is closed until 2016, which means you have to make at least 2 transfers to get anywhere downtown or in Back Bay.  Had I realized this before my stay, I would have probably stayed downtown. Taxi drivers grumbled about driving to East Boston because of the tolls and my Taxi/Uber fares for 2 days cost nearly $100. "1178162	30898031	42122	26854344	Marwa	"Our stay was quite good at Izzy's place. Getting in touch with him was easy, he is very reachable and answers quickly to all the questions. We arrived really early in the morning but we managed to put our stuff in the house before the check-in. The location is perfect for people travelling from the airport - it's a 7 minutes walk to the subway station and a 10 min subway ride to downtown which is fine. The only problem with the house is that there is only one bathroom for 4 rooms, so it's kind of bothering when everyone wants to shower in the morning.And -1 for the cleaning and the garbage that was not changed in the room after the ones that were there before us!But overall it's a good price/value room, specially that it's in the basement so far from the other rooms."1178162	31065702	42125	31210198	Imed	I checked in at midnight. & left at. 9:00 am. The room & bathroom were very clean & quiet. Highly recommend it.1178162	31615118	42131	32304618	Omkar	The place is very close to the Airport T Station. So very convenient to travel around Boston. The listing was as described for the most part. I had the room in the basement. The bathroom was clean and so was the kitchen. I met Izzy on the second and he was very welcoming. Overall I was pleased with the place1178162	31749924	42133	31666495	Lissy	" I enjoyed my stay at Izzy's place. He gave me very detailed directions, so finding his place was a breeze. My room was in the basement which made it feel more private. The room had a fridge, mirror, towels, hangers and even slippers. Sharing a bathroom was a little tricky, but no one ever took too long.  The bathroom did need a bit of cleaning, especially the bathtub. Getting to and from downtown Boston was relatively easy once you get the hang of the subway system. The neighborhood was nice, we saw parents walking their kids to school in the morning and I felt safe walking late at night. Overall this is a great value. I would stay here if I'm ever in Boston again."1178162	32081121	42137	28593986	King Hin	"Izzy is very friendly and he provided assistance when I was there ,which made us feel like living in our own home.The room is clean and tidy. It was also convenient to go to downtown since it is close to the airport station, which take only a few stops to go downtown."1178162	32137028	42138	32352732	Xiaoxi	"I booked this room for my mom and her friends, it the room downstair, Izzy write my name on the board in front of the door and makes me feel welcome. My mom and her friends said they like the room so i give 5 stars for it. "1178162	32542159	42143	1096354	Sarah	"The ''self'' check-in was really easy.The fact that there is just one bathroom for all the guests is not optimal but we manage to make it work.Great location, really close to a subway station and it's easy to get to Downtown Boston."1178162	33255901	42150	15971951	Kenzie	We had a great stay at Izzy's place. The space was as described and in a super convenient location. There are lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance and is a short walk to airport station. We would definitely return! 1178162	33478897	42152	32584563	Erik	"I had an excellent experience at Izzi's place. It was my first Airbnb experience and he took time to explain everything before my arrival. When I arrived, he was very welcoming and easy to talk to. I also got along very well with his house manager, Victoria. They're both awesome people. The room was clean and welcoming. I liked being able to use the fridge and oven and just hang out in the living room. The location was ideal since it was within easy walking distance of the tram and airport, plus there are several good restaurants within a few blocks. I will definitely stay here again when I'm in Boston again."1178162	33742100	42155	20587543	Sonya	"Izzy responded to all messages quickly before the stay. He gave clear directions to property and how to get in. He offered me a place to leave my bag early in the day before check-in. The room was clean and comfortable with a fridge and fan. He was very friendly and offered me suggestions about where to go to dinner and when to leave for my early morning flight. There were many other guests in home and common area but all were polite and quiet. Overall, excellent stay and great value for the area."1178162	33992506	42158	12717709	Daniel	"We had a nice time at Izzy's place, the description of his place was excellent and he provided a lot of nice hints for activities in the city. Generally he is a great host, really relaxed and very caring. There have been other AirBnB guest during our visit but the place was never crowded or overfilled."1178162	34078865	42159	33049657	Michael	Izzy made me feel at home.  He has a great place to stay. I highly recommend him. 1178162	34131596	42160	18003171	Shawn	Great location for next to the airport!  Very nice host!  Izzy was very accommodating with respect to check in and checking out.  It made our stay great!1178162	34536841	42164	7261390	En Hui	"Izzy was great! Very comprehensive instructions on how to get to his place from the airport; we arrived early, meaning to put our luggage in the hall but our room was already ready! He also lives ONE BLOCK away from the awesome Rino's Place - definitely go there and hv your italian meal! Izzy was also most kind to send us to the airport and carry my luggage (with one arm). Thank you Izzy! A pleasure to stay with you!"1178162	34710890	42166	28249766	Curtis	"Very convenient location, about 10 minute walk to airport shuttle and rail. House was quiet and clean, easy in and out."1178162	34806218	42167	34118870	Sara	"We arrived very late, but the home was easy to find and there was someone there waiting to great us. The room was as described, worked perfect for a quick sleep. "1178162	34909635	42168	23657290	Jeffrey	"izzy is a great host. He really makes sure everything is smooth for check-in, move out and luggage storage. All instructions are clear and straightforward. My flight got delayed and i arrived around 11.30 pm and didn't encounter any issues checking in."1178162	35239731	42171	33981202	Catherine	Izzy nous a fait sentir tr̬s bien d̬s notre arriv̩e! Il nous a donn̩ des informations et des suggestions sur quoi faire et o�_ manger! Nous n'avons manqu̩ de rien pendant notre s̩jour! :) 1178162	35680634	42176	31923052	Moritz	This was my second Airbnb experience. It was easy and uncomplicated. The neighborhood was fine and safe. Everything from grocery store to Metro station was in close walking distance. I will definitely stay at Izzy's again!1178162	35835374	42177	31003664	Ding	"reach this place by Uber. It is good, clean and conformable. The room is in basement which I don't know before negotiate with the host. Still, house is good, clean. This is the most important!"1178162	35954374	42178	33593464	Corinna	I only stayed for one night. The room was really nice and Victoria was very helpful with everything :) I really enjoyed the stay.1178162	36103312	42180	20514390	Lars	"We can recommend this accommodation. But you should know, this is not a ""real"" AirBnB experience. We didn't meet Izzy at our days in Boston. But this is not a negative point. If you read Izzy's description completely he mentions this. The house is more like a small hostel with lots of travellers than a private room. Unfortunately there is only one bathroom (one shower) which sometimes causes in problems at the morning. Our room and bathroom were clean. The location is a good point to explore the city and is not far away from the airport. Metro is 5 min away by foot. There are also some supermarkets and other shops not far away."1178162	36337085	42182	12912454	Jinlian	Izzy was great! Everything was organized properly and she gave clear instructions which made getting there and moving in to our room easy! Also we were lucky to have to room downstairs which allowed us to have a bit more privacy. Everything was well organized and clean even in bathroom and kitchen making us feel welcome.1178162	36420612	42183	5141424	Pasqual	"Hey Izzy,thanks for having me in your apartment. I found it most convenient and it was just perfect for my purpose. I did like the area with the Mexican and specifically Columbian Restaurants!"1178162	36682200	42185	19077503	Joyce	"I didn't get to meet Izzy but he had a friend that greeted us. His place is nice but a little bit dusty. The room, kitche, bathroom, has everything you need. The bed is comfortable. It's a good space for two people. The neighborhood is so-so, our neighbors were having a reggae party that made it hard to sleep. "1178162	36828573	42186	33079919	Airi	"Great place! Izzy had things explained and laid out really nicely, was very easy to find the place from the T station. "1178162	36990201	42188	35957819	Austin	"Great space. Cozy and right off the airport, very easy to find. I'd have stayed here even if we weren't arriving quite late but oh was it nice to get from the airport to the room in under 8 minutes (and $12 cab fare, with tip).  Nice, open kitchen and living room that we had no time to use, sadly.Izzy has apple accommodations. Towels, sheets, kitchenware, even emergency toiletries in case you've forgotten yours. This was my first AirBNB trip and it certainly left a great impression."1178162	37103198	42189	33377370	Marina	"I really liked the place! specially if you need to reach the airport early in the morning, this place is just a couple blocks away from the airport metro station! My room (D) was clean and huge, and I was welcomed at my arrival. The house has other people but it is very quiet and has really nice common areas! I would totally stay here again next time!!!"1178162	37500401	42192	35957819	Austin	"Great space. Cozy and right off the airport, very easy to find.

It was very clean and easy to get to/from, and Izzy's assistant, Victoria was very helpful. I'd definitely recommend it for an inexpensive place to stay in Boston!"1178162	38361181	42199	36396485	Julian	"Muy buena ubicaci�_n si se viene desde el aeropuerto, muy cerca al centro, excelente limpieza, es una experiencia de hotel."1178162	38759858	42203	2412576	Isabelle	"Izzy was friendly. The house was fine.  The instructions were good.  I liked the ethnically diverse neighborhood, especially the Brazillian restaurant, Oliverias, and the Italian Place, Rino's.  There is also an amazing Candlepin Bowling (the original bowling with small wooden balls) Alley, called Central Park Lanes right down the street.  The house was fine, clean and well stocked.  We were in the basement which was comfortable, well furnished and clean.  I wish I had known I was going to get the basement room. I probably wouldn't have stayed there.  It was a little stuffy and the stairs down felt really narrow.  Luckily we were able to open the windows.  Cold air drops so it was also nice and cool in the basement. Overall, I would stay here again but request a room upstairs."1178162	38858114	42204	34827402	Sascha	"Although we didn't get a chance to meet Izzy everything was as described. The instructions provided were very clear and we had no trouble finding the place and the room. There are several rooms in the house which was actually more like a small youth hostel. There were other guests present using the shared facilities (kitchen/bath room/living room), however it was no issue. Sometimes there may be a waiting time for the bath room as there is only one. For us it provided what we were looking for: a place (VERY!) close to the airport to spend one night. The neighbourhood is not the most affluent one but we didn't feel unsafe at any time (weren't out at night though)."1178162	40097737	42213	15351471	Dan	"Overall, we were not too impressed with our stay. This is mainly due to a lack of communication between the host and us. We arrived after a very long journey, with no idea where we should go or how to proceed. We stumbled upon our room but never given our own key for our whole stay. The bathroom was inconveniently placed on a different floor to us and was shared with approx. 3 other guests, making for plenty of waiting time. The location is conveniently near the logan airport station and our room was in fact very nice and spacious making for a comfortable stay but it would have been a lot better if the host was actually there to help out."1178162	40348222	42215	35788297	Gabriel	Nous avons bien aimer notre s̩jour en g̩n̩ral!

Je vous conseil d'apporter vos propre draps et oreillers.Aucun probl̬me aussi avec les autres airbnbers.1178162	40649742	42217	24819485	Allyson	Izzy was really helpful. He was constantly suggesting things to do and the best way to get from point A to point B. He was friendly and well informed. The room was clean and we enjoyed our stay very much!1178162	40920206	42219	24491685	Joshua	"Awesome, great dude he will have a drink with you tell you where to go and will share experiences with you would recommend "1178162	41141919	42220	39164055	Germain	"S̩jour rapide �� Boston, nous ne sommes rest̩s qu'une nuit chez Izzy.La chambre ̩tait propre, de m̻me que les espaces communs.Tr̬s bon accueil, instructions tr̬s claires pour acc̩der �� la maison et �� la chambre.Ambiance sympathique avec les autres locataires Airbnb.Localisation proche du M̩tro Airport, pratique pour rejoindre le centre, et pour y acc̩der depuis l'a̩roport avec la navette bleue (1 station).Nous recommandons vivement ce lieu !Merci encore !"1178162	41561154	42223	40441223	Lijing	������Ӫ ����ѫ�Ϭ�ϡ��܌�_  �Ί����_ ��ξ_� �Ǎ�َѫ�__��� �����Ȍ�Όɦ��о�������_��Ɍ�_���1178162	41562486	42223	22273802	Ralf	"Nothing like ""a private room"" it's an outdated / renovation overdue house in a strange area/location. Room was dusty (Floor), staircase to the room in the basement was tiny. Somebody used the wash-machine (basement.....) at 1:45. As there wasn't an air conditioning, we had to leave windows open and got woken up often by either passing cars (windows face to the street) or talking people. Cut it short : the house is used to rent out the rooms, the friendly caring lady is taking care about things but the whole thing is commercial. Better add some money and go into a real hotel. Price isn't cheap either. Never again ! It's an abuse of Airbnb ! "1178162	42083628	42226	40649244	David	Pretty nice room. Izzy wasn't there but his assistant was very friendly. Location is just fine.1178162	42224175	42227	22346044	Douglas	Great location. Nice neighborhood.  Blue line is within walking distance.   Logan airport nearby.  Perfect if you need to catch a flight.  Highly recommend. 1178162	42887293	42232	11304186	Oihane	Everything was as we expected. The bedroom was as the description says and even the bathroom was shared with the other guest it was clean. Also we had a very nice evening with Izzy and his friends.1178162	43490523	42236	27488796	John	"Did not meet Izzy, but his assistant was in the house when we arrived.Izzy's instructions from Logan Airport to the house were spot on as were the instructions for entry. The room was just as advertised. No air con, but large room fan supplied and was ok. The remainder of the house had air con. Kitchen facilities very good, plenty space and hot water. No problems with the neighbour hood. We did plenty walking and sampled a couple of cafes and a restaurant which were great. Food mostly south and meso American.Cheers  John and Jill  ( Scotland)"1178162	44980078	42246	41304356	An-Li	"The location is awesome, close to the heart of Boston and every tourist site. But the room didn't seem to be cleaned from the last tenant."1178162	45118236	42247	24129912	Tina	"I never met Izzy. Instructions to get into the place were clear. It just took us a few minutes inside to figure out which was our room. It is set up a bit like a hostel, with 4 guest rooms in 1 house. The location was fantastic, within walking distance of the airport. The room was fine, though in a basement and a little humid. The house is in ok condition, with fairly old fixtures but clean. "1178162	45739543	42252	38540913	Yixiang	The house locates near the airport subway station and there is a small mart nearby. Fabiana is a friendly girl to help us get used to this house. The other roommates are friendly as well.1178162	46121460	42255	33814203	Marie-Sophie	"Izzy aime les gens et ̤a transparąt. Il est tr̬s accueillant et donne de tr̬s bonnes indications des endroits �� visiter �� Boston. Comme la station de m̩tro Airport est situ̩e �� cinq minutes du logement, nous avons pu laisser notre voiture stationn̩e toute la fin de semaine. C'est vrai, il y a beaucoup de voyageurs chez Izzy, mais la plupart save se comporter en soci̩t̩. Seul b̩mol, il n'y a qu'une salle de bain pour quatre chambres, ̤a peut cr̩er des bouchons �� certains moments dans la journ̩e. "1178162	46536780	42258	42838376	Elle Gemma	"This place was great. Clean, perfect location, cute neighborhood, and friendly host. Izzy was kind enough to chat with us when we arrived, provide recommendations for late night bars and food in the area, teach us about the transportation system and even give us beers after a stressful travel experience. Would definitely stay here again."1178162	47486681	42266	12099974	Sandy	The host is very organized and helpful. It is a pleasant place to stay. Wish we could stay for more days. Maybe next time. :)1178162	48282056	42272	16342545	Stephanie	We stayed for one night in Izzy's house. The room was clean and had everything we needed. Izzy and his father were friendly hosts. We enjoyed talking to them. The house is located in a nice neighbourhood and very close to the Airport and the city of Boston. We would stay with Izzy again.1178162	48898507	42276	31705174	Zbigniew	"Nice apartment, very convenient location. Host was very friendly."1178162	49075017	42277	45071463	Neri	"Izzy was very welcoming. This was my first airb&b experience and it was a positive one. He is located in a great location close to the t metro system, which is great if your traveling to Boston and want to get around for cheap."1178162	49483627	42281	42941326	Ross	"Everything was as mentioned. The host was very friendly. The house is in a really great neighborhood, some of the best mexican food aboit 2 blocks away. The bed was a futon, not the most uncomfortable but still not a bed if that is what you require.  Had a great time!"1178162	49986971	42285	41622354	Malcolm	Great location with good amenities. Izzy was helpful and informative. The house is more like a hostel but perfect for a couple days stay in Boston.1178162	50146105	42286	41846102	Raphael	"The house is near the airport and the neighbourhood is a nice area with many (but expensive) cornershops. The check-in procedure was conveniant and the room and the house is well equipped. If  you want to get downtown, you can get a free ride with the silver line from the airport, which inbound-service is always for free. We had a pleasant stay!"1178162	50696273	42290	6622276	Sarah	Everything was easy and as described. Perfect location for an early morning flight out of Logan. 1178162	50932592	42293	37602376	Lucila	Todo perfecto y acorde a lo que pactamos. Izzy nos explic�_ a la perfecci�_n como llegar a su casa y estaba el cuarto listo cuando llegamos. Buena experiencia y muy recomendable la casa!!1178162	52068762	42303	43108005	Radhika	"I don't think it was a good experience. The room was in the basement, while the bathroom was on the ground floor. The heater in the room was not functioning well. Don't think it was worth the money. "1178162	52616773	42308	39161770	Eric	"Great spot for proximity to airport!  If headed to room from downtown on subway, be sure to walk over bridge to other side of tracks while still in the station!  Dont walk out of the wrong exit out of station!  Cause they you will have a long walk!  But if you walk over bridge and take the right exit you are a short walk.  Free shuttle from subway station makes this great for catching early morning flights.  Seems like a high volume rate of guests here so definitely has a hostel feel.  Great for leisure travrlers."1178162	53220248	42314	19982491	Melina	"It was a great experience! The apartment is very well placed, close to the airport, 10 minutes walking. It was absolutely clean! I didn't meet Izzy, but was very welcomed by a guy who works with him. The room is placed in the basement and there are a toilet and a bathroom sink. There is no other placed to stay. This private room is the best option in Boston."1178162	53353068	42316	37687187	Marta	L'amfitri�_ no va contestar cap dels meus e-mails ni missatges abans d'arribar.L'habitaci�_ era tal i com es descriu a l'anunci i estava neta.

The room was as advertised, clean, and well equipped, with easy access to the airport. Overall, it fit my needs of a convenient/reasonably priced place to stay for 1 night. "1178162	55083240	42335	48484486	Katie	"Wonderful stay, beautiful room, close to airport "1178162	55543602	42339	36013636	Zoe	"We did not meet Izzy, but the instructions and listing information gave us all the info we needed. It was all we needed for 1 night close to the airport. The house seemed busy, with someone sleeping on the couch when we left."1178162	56001294	42345	36499468	Nick	"The experience was great. It was a self check in airbnb, which is the first time I'd ever done that. The directions to get into the place were very clear and easy to follow. The location was right by the airport station on the blue line of T, a six minute walk total. The room was clean and the house was inviting. Great stay!"1178162	57395032	42363	16935056	Muthita	"The neighborhood looks quiet but I felt safe. The house was nice and clean as shown in the picture. It was also pretty convenient to get from place to place as the train station is just a few blocks away. Although I didn't get to meet Izzy, from the conversation we had through messages, he was very understanding and nice. Our housemates are kind too. Overall, my friend and I did have a good experience in Boston. Thank you for letting us stay, Izzy!"1178162	58713980	42372	5967817	Peter	Was able to score this place at the last minute. Very easy peasy to access to this place from Logan Airport. She left detailed instructions on how to find/access to this house.What's even better is that I was allowed to leave my bag here after checking out so I could check out Boston before departing. That's an A plus in my book.Would recommend to  my friends.1178162	59178493	42376	40707505	Shihkai	Good house and clean room! Awesome1178162	59434723	42379	52937879	Chris	"Great room, had all necessities that we needed. We didn't get to see Izzy, but was not a problem. Excellent experience."1178162	60099509	42387	50576464	Jose	Very good1178162	60247907	42389	41413549	Shelby	"Our stay was great! We arrived much later than anticipated but the instructions for the self check in were easy to follow and we were fast asleep in no time at all. Great setup, everything is labeled and it is a warm atmosphere. We really enjoyed ourselves! Thanks a bunch! "1178162	60373755	42391	4094058	Shawn	Very efficient and well run home. Easy to get to from public transit.1178162	60658794	42394	41736409	Huy	"The room was very cozy and nice with all the necessary utilities like portable heater, towels, blankets, etc. I enjoyed my stay a lot."1178162	61448548	42404	52872369	Victor	"I didn't get to meet Izzy but we exchanged some messages and he seemed to be really nice, the room was cozy and clean, I would definitely stay at this place again."1178162	61965911	42409	5796874	Matej	Room is nice an clean with all the necessary utilities. Just a few stops from the city center with a train. Overall a great experience and highly recommended.1178162	62197610	42412	19533158	Sarah	"The only thing I messed up was not looking at the page of information after we booked. All the information you need to check in and get settled into your room was all there. I did call Izzy and he responded promptly through phone or text. The room was secluded and the place was quiet. I recommend Rino's restaurant, which is like 5 minutes from Izzy's!! Definitely recommend staying here."1178162	62598263	42415	57068491	Nazneen	"I was in the basement room so it was a bit cold but there was a nice portable heater and a small refrigerator. It had nice shelving to hang your clothes and a clean bed. Overall, a great place to stay. Thank you!"1178162	62846956	42417	57075507	Shambhavi	"This was our first experience with Airbnb and it was amazing! We had the room in the basement which was very private, clean, and warm on one of the coldest days in Boston. There was a space heater we could use which helped, on the day it was -30 degrees Celsius outside. There were also clean extra blankets, lots of pillows and the bed was very comfortable and clean as well. The host also provided us with clean towels, and we were able to lock our door for privacy. The lady we talked with was also very kind and friendly. The location is also very close to the airport subway station, which makes it easy to get around. I would definitely stay here again thank you so much for your hospitality!  "1178162	63502903	42423	49428419	Amy	"Izzy's home is really well located in a nice neighbourhood with easy access to the airport and downtown Boston. However we found it a bit strange that we didn't meet Izzy once - we like to choose our hosts based on their personal profile as well as the room listing so this was a bit disappointing. The lady who was there was very sweet and showed us where everything was but we didn't really click so we didn't spend much time at all in the communal areas. The room is spacious with plenty of natural light and was fairly clean, however there was a really loud vent that came on and off all the time, I'm not a particularly light sleeper but it often woke me and there were no ear plugs provided or option to turn it off as it heats the whole house. Overall we had a fine stay, it was a lot more like a bnb (without the breakfast) or a hostel than a home, but it was all ran professionally and other than the noise we had no real problems."1178162	63845448	42427	306481	Matthew	"Pleasant one night stay at Izzy's home. The bed was comfortable, the room (and house overall) was very clean, and directions for check-in were clear. Amazing value!"1178162	64028557	42428	39659332	Isabelle	The apartment was cozy and clean and came with all the necessary utilities. The basement room also included a small heater and refrigerator. Overall a pleasant experience and would stay here again. 1178162	64342245	42431	5007437	Madeline	"I had a great stay at Izzy's. The apartment is easy to access and the self check in was a breeze. The room was comfortable and private, and all the amenities were clean and organized. I had a lovely breakfast with Rosa, who made fresh bread, and the other guests. Definitely a great choice when traveling through Boston!"1178162	65752221	42445	17799773	Jesse	"The stay at Izzy's was just what I needed.  Communication was quick and easy, I was able to drop off my luggage early, the room was clean and as advertised.  Great location for me going to the airport and was able to immediately catch an Uber even at 4 in the morning."1178162	66000820	42447	37267796	Guyomar	"Very nice private room. For the price, it's unbeatable. Not really central, but close to T station (blue line). Nice clean bathroom, cozy space. Would stay again."1178162	67047132	42455	20980903	Soma	This was our second time stay although on a different room which turned out even better. There was so much privacy since the room is downstairs with a (URL HIDDEN)'t meet Izzy this time but Rosa was sweet and helpful too. Highly recommend this place.1178162	68489258	42465	19934237	Willa	"I had a great stay at Izzy's place. Izzy was quick and helpful in communication. The instructions for getting into the house and finding the room were very clear and worked, no problem. We locked ourselves out of our room at one point and the woman watching the house had a spare which was a relief.The room and house were as described and very comfortable. I slept really well! The neighborhood was lovely and getting to and from the subway was very easy and convenient to the rest of Boston."1178162	69037798	42468	6364570	Linus	This was a cozy room with a comfortable bed. We felt very welcome. Great location if you're coming in from the airport. Izzy was really helpful.1178162	69710156	42472	12545431	M̩lanie	Tr̬s pratique pour allez �� l'a̩roport !Chambre agr̩able ;)1178162	71281937	42484	66982146	Michael	"Host house was very clean and welcoming! Our room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. We were in Boston for Pax East this weekend, and so were away from the host home for a vast majority of the time. The neighborhood was quiet, with a nice park nearby which lead directly to public transit, and was only about a 36 minute commute to the convention center via bus. We hope to attend PAX again next year, and Izzy's place just might have to be our same choice!"1178162	71923132	42489	43014437	Robert	"I arrived late at nite and did a self check-in, leaving early the next morning for a flight out of Logan. Everything was as described, no problems with the checkin-in or anything else. Perfect place to stay if you have an early morning flight."1178162	72827170	42494	43837135	Rochelle	"If you're looking for a clean, quiet place for a stopover in Boston near the airport, this is the place! I was quite pleased with my stay! Just minutes from the airport in a quiet, working class neighborhood dotted with great restaurants and markets. Our basement room was clean and quiet. The house was full but all the other guests were polite and friendly. The common areas were clean and inviting. Izzy provides quick and simple self check-in and check-out instructions. We walked to a great restaurant, Rino's, from Izzy's place. Great home base in Boston!"1178162	72986314	42496	65486952	Greg	"Izzy's place was great. Good price, conveniently located, easy to find and get into."1178162	75077454	42508	63408239	Song Ho	It was amazing to stay in Izzy's place. The house was beautiful clean and organized! Highly recommended!1178162	76676154	42518	67050649	Kristina	Great place to stay near the airport and easy to get downtown. The self check-in was perfect for us so we didn't have to disturb anyone getting in from a late flight. Izzy was great at responding to all of our questions and making the reservation for us. 1178162	77616640	42523	66816280	Patrick	"Izzy wrote a welcoming message on the door of our room.  There are two other renters and it was enjoyable meeting and talking with them.   We never met or spoke with Izzy but talked with a women who tried her best to assist us but could not.  The room was fine but the experience was negatively affected by the difficult parking.  Most streets are two hours only unless you have a sticker.  We spent too much time trying to find nearby overnight parking and there was none. After much frustration, we finally located parking about 1/2 mile away.  We had use of the kitchen for breakfast, but the pots and pans for cooking were not as good as we might have liked.  In summary, the room was fine but the parking and kitchen made this a negative experience."1178162	77655719	42523	62099445	Lan	"Wonderful. Close to the airport and easy to get here. Lots of stores open even at night. Safe and quiet neighborhood, clean and comfortable bedroom. I really enjoy my stay in Boston."1178162	77800814	42524	67926581	Sigridur	We liked our stay even though it was just for one night. Very close to the airport. 1178162	78761345	42530	72710972	John	"Very close to the airport, clear directions. Nice one bedroom with bathroom upstairs. Host was efficient! An AC unit would have been helpful! "1178162	79985112	42536	70848751	Audrey	"Great location, comfortable room, clean common areas, friendly guests, easy check-in. Not a five-star resort, but if you want a clean,  comfortable bedroom for the night it's great!"1178162	80579637	42540	69010232	Alex	"Check-in/check-out was easy and it waa easy to get to the house from the metro station which took me only 5 mins or even less. The house was clean but only problem was that there was only one bathroom but other than, the house is a perfect place to stay. "1178162	81721003	42545	6209791	Rebecca	I was happy to find a sort of communal hostel upon my return from nine months of backpacking thru South America. There was no way I was going to stay in some awful franchise but I wanted something near the airport for a late night arrival after long international flights. I was very happy with my stay - the room was comfortable and the shared facilities were well organized and welcoming. Because I was jet lagged I went straight to bed but would have otherwise been interested in spending time with the other travelers staying here. Additionally there were a number of Salvadoran restaurants that looked  great - cheap and cheerful - so you can have tasty ethnic food just minutes from the door. The neighborhood is safe and friendly - it's a low income Hispanic residential section of town - and I enjoyed walking around smiling and waving to the locals sitting on their stoops.1178162	82732149	42550	19338623	Kate	"I spent three nights here and enjoyed my stay. I never saw the host, and there were other guests staying at the house. I don't think anyone actually lives here and the house is used for air bnb, but I'm not entirely sure. The location is super convenient to the airport and to the T that gives you access to the City of Boston. Family neighbourhood that was very quiet. The bed is super comfortable and the interent was great.  Izzy also kindly let me store luggage in the house during the day before my early evening flight."1178162	84287344	42557	55352755	Theresa	"I was very thankful to find this place.  I was stranded over night in Boston, and this place was available and within walking distance of the airport (after the free shuttle ride to the train station). I never saw Izzy or anyone else. It's a little pricey for the quality, and smells like animal in one area, but it was exactly what I needed, when and where I needed it! "1178162	85895012	42564	55990155	Carolyn	"The house was easy to find from the airport train staton, just a quick walk through the park. On our first night we met friends for dinner and after dropping off our things, I noticed a sign on the park gates saying 'closed at 11 pm'. We had a bit of a rush to make it back in time and got off the T at 10.56! I am not sure how observant they are of the park closing times, but it's something to keep in mind. The basement room was clean, comfortable and private, which I appreciated. Having one bathroom for a house with 4 bedrooms meant that there was often a wait for the shower/ toilet, but we managed. There were plenty of Boston brochures and maps about the house for guests to use, which was handy, great to help us decide how to use our three days in town. The house was clean and welcoming, with the hand towel and bath mat seemingly changed daily. The shower did need a bit of a clean though the rest of the bathroom as spotless. we could have done with a towel rail or some kind of hooks on which to hang our towels in our room. Otherwise despite the heat, they could be slow to dry. We loved the fact it wa just 3 stops from the action, so getting in in the morning and home at night was such a simple and quick process. Very happy withour stay."1178162	88009541	42573	10558679	Manuela	Super1178162	92398316	42590	36583311	Dylia	"The house is clean and our room was just as described. It is very close to the metro station and only a few stops away from downtown. The instructions to get to the house from the airport were also very helpful and easy to follow. Izzy was very helpful with suggestions for things to do in Boston. We had the opportunity to interact not only with him but with his assistant Fabi and other gusts as well. Everyone was very nice and polite. If you're looking for a clean and affordable place to stay in Boston, Izzy 's place is definitely a good option. "1178162	92753889	42591	8388938	Isaac	"Me and my wife rented this room for 1 night.Location was good, near to the airport. The room and common spaces were clean. I highly recommend."1178162	93633143	42595	54400090	Matthew	"Property was easy to find, extremely clean, very safe, and convenient to the airport and rental car areas.  Much easier than staying at a hotel nearby for more money.  Izzy was very easy to reach and a great host!"1178162	94675484	42598	17356185	Giulia	"nothing what I expected !we start from the position..the house is in a very bad boston district where there is nothing and there live exclusively Latinos (hispanic district) ! the metro is a 10 min walk but if you come back late at night you have to go for strength to a park where there are not recommended subjects . we had always come back soon because we were afraid something happened to us ! neighborhood dirty, ugly people , no restaurant !as it regards the room was in the basement ... with a small WC designed in under 1 meter scale .all very dirty and very poorly maintained.nobody helped us by giving us indicationsterrible experience ."1178162	95628487	42602	52195225	Shijing	"The house uses a self check-in way, the guest can follow the instruction  the host sends before arrival, it was easy and simple. The place is very clean, and we saw a shelf with all those clean towels. we stayed at the first floor, but since one has to go upstairs to get into the house, you have to go downstairs to get into this bedroom. But there are windows and light can get into the bedroom. The owner was not in the house, but there are stickers with instructions on them all over the house, so it was very convenient. The owner's friend also lives in that house, so she can help guests with what they need."7246272	49011639	42277	41266959	Juliano	"My wife and I had a great experience while staying with Alex and Bob. The house is very organized and the room was great. Everything was very clean and the decoration was very beautiful. The neighborhood is nice and the house is near restaurants, pubs and markets where you can purchase whatever you need. The T is not far: about 15 minutes walking.The hosts were caring and were always thinking about our necessities and about how they could make us comfortable. Alex and Bob are both great guys and our stay couldn't have been better!! Alex was our host during our stay. He's an amazing human being and was always there for us.Thank you so much, guys.I hope we can see you again soon."7246272	49287275	42279	8942041	Hannah	Had a great time at Robert and Alex's place. The room is stylish and comfortable and the gardens are beautiful! Not far from the T. I enjoyed my stay and hanging out with Alex!7246272	50085405	42286	30324147	Leith	"We were welcomed by Rob on early arrival and he very helpfully allowed us to leave our luggage until check in time. This was much appreciated.The room and facilities were excellent and were as they appeared on their website.  There is plenty of storage and hanging space, and the extra jets in the shower were very soothing after hard days walking!We were able to use the kitchen facilities for breakfast and our evening meal and we also used their washing machine and dryer.The 12 minute walk to the train station was fine in the day - we didn't come home after dark so can't make a comment on that. The location was not quite as we'd expected .   There weren't many restaurants in close proximity although there were a couple of convenience stores close by.  "7246272	50367275	42288	45325384	Warren	"It was a first AirBnB experience for my girlfriend and I and honestly, we did not expect such a nice stay. Alex was a wonderful host and such a nice person! The room was perfectly clean with an AMAZING private bathroom.  The neighbourhood was nice and the train was not far from the condo (10 min walk). There are also other little surprises that made our stay very pleasant but enough spoilers! We highly recommend this bedroom rental."7246272	50468704	42289	41772558	Benjamin	Had a great experience!! Alex was a great host!! The premise was amazing and had a beautiful garden display!! We would not hesitate to stay again!! Thank you!! 7246272	50926970	42293	19684942	Guy & Jeanette	Alex and Bob's flat is decorated with attention to detail. Alex was a great host. We loved his messages.7246272	51131704	42295	42146325	Rob	"The place was wonderful - we had a beautifully-decorated & impeccably-kept private room, with a new-looking full bath, comfortable queen bed & full closet. Alex made sure he was there to greet us, & went out of his way to make us feel comfortable & welcome, with pre-printed maps to a great, walkable restaurant & the T stop - we used the T frequently to go all over Boston. He & Robert had snacks set out for us, & clearly take great pride in the condition & tasteful decorating of our room & the whole condo/townhouse.My wife & I DEFINITELY recommend this place, & would ABSOLUTELY stay there again on our next trip to Boston!"7246272	51926291	42302	3791315	H̩ctor	"We stayed two nights with Bob and Alex and it could not have been better. They received us on Friday evening with a really beautiful home and a welcoming message posted on the fridge! :) Everything was perfectly arranged and every detail was taken care of. The bedroom and the house were really comfortable (we fall in love with the mattress!). The description is really accurate, everything is more than clean and it makes you feel at home. We will definitely be back. Totally recommended. "7246272	52191067	42303	28233388	Rebecca	"Alex was extremely helpful and accommodating. He gave us a map of the area, gave us suggestions for places to go out/restaurants, and even provided us with a Charlie card (to use for public transit)! The listing is just like the pictures: extremely clean, lovely, and pleasant all-around. Essentially, Alex keeps a nice home. I'd read online that Dorchester is a ""rougher"" part of Boston, so I asked Alex about this. He reassured me that as long as we stay on big streets, we'd be fine; I didn't at any point feel insecure in my safety. The neighborhood's cute and within walking distance of various restaurants. "7246272	53378365	42316	6919142	Pam	The room was nicely decorated and the bed very comfortable. We liked the walk-in closet and the huge bathroom.7246272	54330504	42326	43218503	Maria	Alex was a great host. His personal touches make you feel like you are right at home.

I highly recommend staying with Alex!7246272	54527932	42329	47930937	Yoshi	"They are the nicest people I have ever met. We landed to Boston at around 1 am and then took uber to get to their place, but we told the driver wrong address, and we did not get to their place until like 3 am. But Alex was up and waiting for us to welcome. Room was simply amazing. No doubt  to give them five stars."7246272	54617219	42330	33235010	Will	This is a great room with everything you need and more. The en suite bathroom is the best I've seen at an Airbnb.

You've got your own entrance to your room and Alex (the host) respects your privacy, but if you want to go to the living room and interact with him, you'll find a kind guy to talk to.The place is very clean, I mean very very clean. I had a lovely time staying there."7246272	65519027	42444	18943353	Etienne	"ENGLISHMe and my girlfriend returned from a 3 days stay at Alex and Bob. We were warmly welcomed by Alex who was able to properly advise us throughout our stay. The condo is beautiful and the room we occupied for three nights was very cozy. The bed is extremely comfortable and the ensuite bathroom includes a huge shower which is perfect after a tiring day of walking and visiting. The red line (Boston Subway) passes near the condo, which makes it easier to visit and travel from one part of the city to another. We had a small problem with our bikes rental with Hubway (the bike sharing system in Boston), but fortunately, Bob and Alex were kind enough to offer us their help and called the Hubway company, which helped a lot and saved us from wasting time making calls.We are more than satisfied with our stay and recommend this Airbnb without any hesitation. We hope to return at Alex and Bob in the future. Thanks again guys and take care! ��tienne & Sophie FRAN��AISMoi et ma copine revenons d�۪un s̩jour de trois jours �� Boston o�_ nous avons eu la chance de rester dans le Airbnb de Alex et Bob.

From the very first contact with them, until the day I left, they made me feel that they cared about making my trip great. Both Alex and Bob where readily available through texting and calls if I needed them. Bob also texted me or called me several times during my trip to make sure that I was doing okay. I was a single, female, traveler in a big city, so I really appreciated him checking on me and making sure I was doing alright. Alex often asked me if I needed anything or if there was anything that needed refreshing in my room. The two of them anticipated the needs of a traveler and the room was set up great. The room was very clean and comfortable. Coffee readily available in the morning very important for this Traveler! They were also great in helping me know what the city had to offer and all the cool places to visit. They had maps printed out and available for local restaurants that are within walking distance as well as directions to the nearest T Station. I can't say enough about these two hosts. They made my stay even better than I anticipated and when I come back to Boston, if they are available, I will definitely book with them again. I highly recommend their place!"7246272	70658731	42479	50865218	Alena	"My wife and I could not have asked for a better experience than we had with Alex (and Bob), both were outstandingly accommodating and made us feel as if we were at home. Every morning Alex had breakfast items laid out for us and coffee ready to brew, along with delicious fresh baked coconut chocolate cookies and banana bread brownies. The room we stayed in was perfectly kept, all our amenities were provided, and the shower is just something you will have to see for yourself! Alex was very personable (and so was Bob) to talk top and we enjoyed all our conversations, and he even gave us some great pointers on improving our green thumb (he is an exceptional gardener). If you want to give the non-traditional tourist trip to Boston, then Alex and Bob are the perfect people to get you started; from restaurant recommendations and attractions to understanding the public transportation and local history, they make sure you are taken care of every step of the way. If we ever come back to Boston, we know where we'd want to stay."7246272	71114337	42483	66258599	Connor	"Alex was very nice and made us feel right at home!!

It was the perfect spot, we had our own mini apartment inside their home with an amazing shower! We parked our car with no problem in their parking lot overnight which was very convenient.

Everything else was awesome too. Nice bright colors and super clean.Alex helped us out a lot! When we got there he printed out tour guides and info about the transportation in the city. When we had to leave Boston, we had a super early flight in the morning. I just mentioned that we had to leave early and he offered to take us, without hesitation. We haven't been on Airbnb long but this one place made our whole trip. Alex and Bob are the best!

Before we arrived Alex was helpful to make sure we would be able to find the place. The location is quite convenient. A 10-15 minute walk will get you to the metro that takes you to downtown Boston in less than 15 minutes. Upon arrival Alex was there to welcome us and could always be reached if we needed anything. The room and the adjacent private bathroom were really nice and clean, just like how it is shown on the pictures. We had good nights of sleep on the comfortable bed and there was hardly any noise from outside. The room is nicely decorated and has a big TV. Wifi is also accessible and of good quality. We were allowed to use the kitchen and Alex made space in the fridge available for us. There was fresh coffee when we wanted.Both Alex and Rob are very friendly people and are nice to talk to.

Our room was extremely clean and comfortable, which had complimentary bottled water, basket of beach goodies, and travel size toiletries in the bathroom for travelers to use.

It's a perfect location to explore the entire city."1365335	20244440	41908	122720	Mariel	"Even though Christine was overseas during my stay, her warmth and sense of welcome was so abundantly clear in the emails that I felt like she was not far away at all.  Her home is lovely--feels quite European in fact, so visitors from across the Atlantic would feel right at home.The neighborhood is beautiful -- restaurants and coffee shops and parks within a couple of blocks. She responded to correspondence with lightning speed.  I had to figure a lot of things out before booking, and she was incredibly patient through that process.A very generous host who was very kind and flexible about checkout times and insisted that I make myself at home!"1365335	30327615	42114	19806432	Tison	"One of the most gracious hosts I've met on Airbnb. The place was in gorgeous, quaint and the location was perfect in the south end"1365335	32459719	42142	27732339	Tom	"Christine was the perfect host - helpful before and during our stay. She left abundant maps and recommendations for us to use during our stay, so needless to say she was extremely helpful. The flat itself is elegant and charming (the picture doesn't do it justice), and is located in a beautiful neighbourhood in the south end of Boston. It's a stone's throw away from loads of great restaurants, and is also just about walking distance to the town centre. There's a bus near by if you're not up for the walk!"1365335	33016825	42148	20024706	Andrea	"Christine was incredibly helpful and generous. She provided a lot of helpful information before I had even left home, and then called me to be sure I had reached her apartment safely. The neighborhood was lovely and the apartment just as described. It was very clean, comfortable, and charming, with all the amenities. She checked in during my stay to be sure everything was going well, and even let me leave my bags there on my last day. I highly recommend her as a host, and would be happy to stay in her place again next time I visit Boston. "1365335	33506666	42153	28708713	Sarah	"I really enjoyed staying at Christine's lovely apartment!  I was there for a week attending a conference at the Boston Convention and Expo Center, and Christine gave me very clear and easy directions from her apartment to the Convention Center.  She was very communicative before I arrived, and checked in with me via email during the week to make sure everything was OK.  She was very generous and helpful, and I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Boston!  The neighborhood is very historical with lots of character - way better than a generic hotel!"9610609	64980716	42438	1396918	Eric	"Judith kindly accommodated a late request for a place in Boston. Things worked out great. The location was ideal, with the waterfront and the Italian North End right there. The room itself faces into an interior atrium (not directly outside). It's plenty roomy, although not yet fully furnished. I knew this going in, and expect that Judith will do great things with the space. Pictures of the interior would have been helpful when I was ""shopping."""9610609	65716595	42445	59807817	Cory	Awesome place right in the middle of the north end of Boston. Within walking distance of all the historical sites.9610609	67982514	42461	63345410	James	"Judith's place was in a great location and she made sure that I had everything I needed! My train coming into Boston prevented me from meeting with her when we originally planned and she was more than accommodating in terms of re-scheduling out meet up. Overall, cool building in an even cooler location! It was a great experience!"4573458	24279579	41997	24374034	Jenn	"Great location, easy to book, wonderful communication with the host.  "4573458	25142353	42011	23036371	Cheryl	"The North End is a fantastic neighbourhood- many food options, close to everything in the city, close to the harbor.Apartment 4 was tidy and cosey, however the wifi did not work and the sofa bed was rickety making it difficult to relax on.All in all a very basic apartment, suitable for people who need only somewhere to sleep and shower."4573458	26893640	42056	27639281	Lijing	"The apartment is not really big but nice and bright. The owner provides all utensils in the kitchen for guest to cook. The beds are soft and we all feel well sleeping on them.  And there are a lot of Italian restaurant around so we shall have delicious food during the two days. In addition, many gelateria are available near the apartment. The only thing that should be concerned is : the password of the Internet on the guidebook is incorrect, I called the hot line and the one on the phone said she will fix it on the following morning. However, when my friends and I came back to the apartment in the evening, the problem had not been solved. Anyway, we do enjoy our trip in Boston and staying in this apartment.  "4573458	28077802	42080	16994827	Isabella	"Everything was perfect! The apartment is beautiful, clean, cozy and has all the facilities you may need, including blow dryer! The location is a plus. Right next to North End's main street (Hanover St), which has tons of nice italian restaurants, and less than 10 min walk to the T (Haymarket Station). My parents and I loved it!"4573458	28247629	42084	9224739	Liam	"Compact, clean and secure apartment in the North End, exactly what were looking for.  Checking in out of hours was really easy and communication was great, would recommend."4573458	28389248	42086	8624984	Vero	This appartment was perfect and cozy.  The location was ideal for our needs and the public parking was 2 minutes walk from the appartment.  Many restaurants and a small grocery store nearby the appartment.  We enjoyed our stay! thanks!4573458	28563755	42089	12130111	Kraig	"We got our exercise, that's for sure.  The apartment building is a block off the Freedom Trail and a block and a half from Paul Revere's house - a great take-off spot to city some of Boston's most famous landmarks.  And with the apartment being on the fourth floor, that helps too.  The place was clean, the beds comfortable - a nice place to call home for our 4 day visit.Located in the middle of North Boston, we were minutes away from an incredible selection of restaurants, coffee shops, and Mike's Pastry - don't miss it.  If you enjoy improvisation or comedy, the Improv Asylum is a fun and inexpensive thing to do 7 nights a week and just three blocks away.The apartment is only six blocks from the ""T"" - Boston's metro system that will get you anywhere in the city, so don't rent a car.  Parking on the North end is not easy or inexpensive.  Just use the public transportation or take a cab, which are plentiful.I would recommend this spot."4573458	30597412	42119	23864923	Ally	This place was very clean and SUPER location.  Easy to pick up keys and great directions given.   Very happy with the whole experience!4573458	30834942	42121	12769251	Ziwen	The instruction was complicated but overall was okay. They process of getting & returning the key took us some time. 4573458	31302173	42128	19426484	Sebastian	"The app was cleaned up and very well located. The kitchen has everything you need, the couch was comfy and the Wifi was fast. A nice app for vacation! We really enjoyed staying there! From the North End it is easy and comfortable to travel to all the different sights in Boston - downtown as well as Cambridge."4573458	32147147	42138	3004162	Lindsay	"The neighborhood is great, and the apartment is very well-kept. The only thing we were a little surprised about is that, in Boston's North End, the apartment doesn't have any wine glasses in it :o)"4573458	33570334	42154	2103376	Mette	"Hurtig og fin respons p̴ henvendelser. Okay lejlighed med 2 sm̴ sovev�_relser og det mest n��dvendige grej i lejlighed og k��kken. Den ene seng knirkede en del, og det ville have v�_ret dejligt med et par vinglas.

The property was a good size and had all the amenities that we needed. Good value in a city that has expensive lodging options. Would absolutely recommend.4573458	37688181	42194	36480585	Joshua	"Great location! Apartment is clean, well-stocked, and comfortable. Wifi, appliances, and fixtures worked well. The process for getting/returning keys is a bit of a hassle, but worth it. It mentions that it is ""4th fl."" but should really mention a warning about the stairs. There are a lot of them and they are steep. Wouldn't recommend it if you are out of shape, elderly, or have small children. Overall a very pleasant place to stay."4573458	38478534	42201	27423786	Joel	This is a beautiful little apartment in the historic North End of Boston.  It's close to Hanover Street and only steps from the Freedom Trail.  4573458	40313787	42215	2521868	Kjartan	The apartment was as advertised. It was clean and comfortable.

Dror and his staff were very kind, professional and so helpful before and during our stay.  Easy check-in and check-out. The apartment is pretty basic but functional and clean - located in the heart of the North End, very close to many lovely places, shops and restaurants. Be aware that it is a historical building and there is no elevator, so if you book apt. #4 (4th floor) I suggest to travel with no heavy baggage.Overall this was a positive experience. Elvia"4573458	43219581	42234	2843734	Wendy	We liked the apartment but not the three flights of steps to get to it. 4573458	44755266	42245	14835606	Giulia	Appartamento molto bello nel cuore del North End. Unico neo: al quarto piano senza ascensore. Pulizie da migliorare ma per gli standard americani buono. Mai incontrato l'host: il recupero e il rilascio delle chiavi facile anche se bisogna chiamare il giorno prima dell'arrivo un numero verde americano.4573458	80334477	42538	35303560	Yunzhou	"The location is great, with very nice Italian restaurants in the neighborhood. Though we didn't meet with Dror in person, he responded quickly.

Dror also provides a place for you to store your luggage for early arrival/late departure, which was convenient and appreciated. I would most definitely stay here again."4573458	86510771	42567	12524214	David	"Reliable key pick-up arrangements, top floor flat hard work to drag suitcases up to (but we knew that). Welcome pack enough for a meal or two available on arrival was appreciated. Minimal air conditioning just about coped in 34degC temperatures, but toilet plumbing failed on our last evening and we've had no apology for that. As made clear, the location is everything with this flat, right in Little Italy but hidden away round a quiet corner from the busyness of Hanover Street. Also very convenient for the short, easy walk to most tourist attractions downtown."4573458	91868762	42589	40550879	Jos̩ Pablo	"Great location.

Very clean, comfortable and convenient ... our vacation to Boston was made that much better because of our accommodations. We love visiting cities and feeling like we live there and 20 Moon Street made us feel like we were at home in another city. The location can't be beat! 10 minutes from the airport. The restaurants, shops and sites in the North End all seemed to be within a few minutes walk. 10 minute walk to Quincy Market and waterfront attractions. We had no trouble getting anywhere in the city we wanted to go. We will definitely be staying here again on future visits to the city.  Dror's listing and hospitality were exactly as advertised and then some.  "5521378	36797996	42186	3094298	Kate	"It was one of the best my airbnb experiences. Karin was sweet! The room is nice, the kitchen is very well furnished (was happy to use Greek ibrik for making coffee every morning), the district is safe and beautiful (hills are good for running).

It was exactly like I expected from the photos.  The room was clean, towels were laid out for me and there were two sweet kitties to greet me.

I highly recommend staying with Karin if you can.  "5521378	61304438	42402	6472875	Anne	"Karin was the perfect hostess for me.  While respecting my privacy, she made me feel welcome. The room was just as I expected, and I had everything I needed.

The check in was super easy and well organized. Having everything I needed.The location is fantastic 5/10 minutes walk to the train station (T) that it takes less than 15 minutes to City Centre. (Try the Mexican restaurant at Amory St., before going back home, you wont regret it). Karin was really helpful providing advice and suggestions for my stay in Boston.

Lots of restaurants and bars in walking distance. Everything in the apt is set for the user, rather than being the host's space. The service, and communication for check-in is excellent.

"4610745	29297718	42100	27243087	Nastassia	"I planned this trip to Boston as a surprise for my boyfriend's birthday and Christian's apartment was absolutely perfect for us! The location is so convenient to everything.  We had two events to attend at TD Garden and we were able to walk over there in only  about 10-15 minutes.  To get anywhere else we jumped on the T just up the street from the apartment which made things so easy.  As for the apartment itself, it was very cozy and gave us the feel of what it would be like to live in the city.  We have no complaints whatsoever although, I do feel it's worth noting that the staircase in the building is narrow and steep and the bathroom is also very small since the building is old.  We found the historical feel of the building cool but neither of us is particularly big/tall so it may not be as comfortable for someone of larger stature. That being said, we found the apartment to be phenomenal.  We would definitely love to stay there again.Not only was the place great, Christian was also the ideal host.  We didn't get to meet him in person but he was so pleasant through all our communication, was quick to respond to any questions I had, and even went the extra mile by offering us detailed recommendations for his favorite spots near the apt and around Boston.  Thank you Christian for being so accommodating and making our first Airbnb experience a great one!!

Even when we had a little mishap and accidentally shorted the power he was quick to reply and directed us expertly with how to resolve the problem! Easy fix and smooth running after that! The apartment was as described and I think better than the pictures on here. Lovely old building. I adored the location and it was easy to get around. Honestly a perfect little getaway. Just what we needed. I can't say enough about it! I would recommend to anyone visiting Boston either for a short weekend away or a longer time. I have also never slept so well! I would give this places a 50 stars if I could! I would love to stay again. Thanks for everything Christian! "4610745	39736612	42211	29941758	Gabriella	"Christian was a great host!

He provided us with beers and soda in the fridge, towels and shampoo, and gave us great advice on where to go to hang out. The apartment itself was fairly old and small, with the bathroom located in the building's stairwell.

Having said that, there was a layer of dust and dirt on everything, we have stayed in enough Air BNB and VRBO places to know this was not professionally cleaned. We have also stayed in many European style places but this bathroom was the least practical we have ever encountered. It was nearly impossible to take a shower and the toilet was in the hallway.
