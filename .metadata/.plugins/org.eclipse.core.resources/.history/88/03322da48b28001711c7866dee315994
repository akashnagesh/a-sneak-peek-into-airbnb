perhaps	1
the	1

purchase	1
I've	1
made	1
in	1

seriously.	1
1	1
Buy	1
a	1

The	1
one	1

The	1
voice	1
recognition	1
thru	1
the	1
handset	1
is	1
excellent.	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
hands	1
down	1
the	1
best	1
phone	1
I've	1
ever	1
had.	1
1	1
Works	1
great,	1
when	1
my	1
cat	1
attacked	1
the	1
phone	1
he	1
scratched	1
the	1
protective	1
strip	1
instead	1
of	1
destroying	1
the	1
screen.	1
1	1
This	1
one	1
works	1
and	1
was	1
priced	1
right.	1
1	1
Customer	1
service	1
was	1
terrible.	1

Now	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
made	1
a	1
wise	1
decision.	1
1	1
Someone	1
shouldve	1
invented	1
this	1
sooner.	1
1	1
Good	1
price.	1
1	1
Everything	1
worked	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
try.The	1
device	1
was	1
certainly	1
engineered	1
in	1
a	1
clever	1
way	1
and	1
the	1
construction	1
feels	1
good.	1
1	1
I	1
received	1
it	1
quickly	1
and	1
it	1
works	1
great!!	1
1	1
Has	1
been	1
working	1
great.	1
1	1
As	1
many	1
people	1
complained,	1
I	1
found	1
this	1
headset's	1
microphone	1
was	1
very	1
weak.	1

My	1
5-year	1
old	1
Nokia	1
2160	1
from	1
Tracfone	1
holds	1
the	1
charge	1
a	1
lot	1
better	1
than	1
this.	1
0	1
They	1
do	1
not	1
care	1
about	1
the	1
consumer	1
one	1
bit.	1
0	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
battery,	1
and	1
it	1
got	1
here	1
really	1
fast.	1
1	1
The	1
instruction	1
manual	1
is	1
lacking.	1
0	1
Also	1
its	1
slim	1
enough	1
to	1
fit	1
into	1
my	1
alarm	1
clock	1
docking	1
station	1
without	1
removing	1
the	1
case.	1
1	1
Phone	1
now	1
holds	1
charge	1
like	1
it	1
did	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
new.	1
1	1
The	1
battery	1
is	1
unreliable	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
service	1
use	1
antena.	1
0	1
It's	1
uncomfortable	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
quality	1
is	1
quite	1
poor	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
phone	1
(Razr)	1
or	1
with	1
my	1
previous	1
wired	1
headset	1
(that	1
plugged	1
into	1
an	1
LG).	1
0	1
We	1
have	1
gotten	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
compliments	1
on	1
it.	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
definitely	1
a	1
must	1
have	1
if	1
your	1
state	1
does	1
not	1
allow	1
cell	1
phone	1
usage	1
while	1
driving.	1
1	1
I	1
want	1
my	1
money	1
back.	1

I	1
love	1
this	1
device.	1
1	1
I	1
am	1
also	1
very	1
happy	1
with	1
the	1
price.	1
1	1
I	1
ordered	1
this	1
product	1
first	1
and	1
was	1
unhappy	1
with	1
it	1
immediately.	1
0	1
The	1
Ngage	1
is	1
still	1
lacking	1
in	1
earbuds.	1
0	1
I	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
voice	1
dialing	1
in	1
the	1
car	1
with	1
no	1
problem.	1
1	1
I	1
have	1
2-3	1
bars	1
on	1
my	1
cell	1
phone	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
home,	1
but	1
you	1
cant	1
not	1
hear	1
anything.	1
0	1
good	1
item,	1
low	1
price.	1
1	1
However-the	1
riingtones	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
best,	1
and	1
neither	1
are	1
the	1
games.	1

The	1
plug	1
did	1

VERY	1

1	1
The	1
battery	1
is	1
working	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
replacement	1
for	1
the	1
original	1
that	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
phone	1
over	1
2	1
years	1
ago.	1
1	1
The	1
reception	1
is	1
excellent!	1
1	1
It	1
fits	1
comfortably	1
in	1
either	1
ear,	1
the	1
sound	1
is	1
clear	1
and	1
loud,	1
and	1
the	1
charge	1
lasts	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
days.	1
1	1
very	1
clear,	1
quality	1
sound	1
and	1
you	1
don't	1
have	1
to	1
mess	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
on	1
your	1
iPod	1
since	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
sound	1
buttons	1
on	1
the	1
headset.	1

some	1

Obviously	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
problem	1
with	1
the	1
adhesive.	1

Very	1
disappointing.	1

It	1
was	1
an	1
inexpensive	1
piece,	1
but	1
I	1
would	1
still	1
have	1
expected	1
better	1
quality.	1
0	1
It	1
is	1
practically	1
useless	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
add	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
boost	1
to	1
my	1

after	1
I	1

it.	1

dropped	1
my	1
phone	1
more	1
times	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
say,	1
even	1
on	1
concrete	1
and	1
my	1
phone	1
is	1
still	1
great	1
(knock	1
on	1
wood!).	1
1	1
Reception	1
is	1

This	1
little	1
device	1
has	1
transformed	1
my	1
organizational	1
capability	1
and	1
made	1
my	1
life	1
a	1
whole	1
lot	1
easier.	1
1	1
I	1
was	1
sitting	1
in	1
my	1
vehicle,	1
with	1
the	1
cradle	1
on	1
my	1
belt,	1
and	1
the	1

The	1

is	1
great,	1
the	1

is	1
very	1
...	1
appealing.	1
0	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
could	1
improve	1
is	1
the	1
sound	1
leaks	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
headset.	1
0	1
First	1
off	1
the	1
reception	1
sucks,	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
2	1
bars,	1
ever.	1
0	1
The	1
phone	1
gets	1
EXTREMELY	1
HOT!	1

The	1
microphone	1
also	1
works	1
well,	1
but	1
(according	1
to	1
people	1
I	1
have	1
called)	1
it	1
applifies	1
everything.	1
1	1
Nice	1
design	1
and	1
quality.	1
1	1
Also,	1
if	1
your	1
phone	1
is	1
dropped,	1
this	1
case	1
is	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
save	1
it,	1
specially	1
when	1
dropped	1
face	1
down.	1
0	1
It	1
is	1
light,	1
easy	1
to	1
use,	1
and	1
has	1
very	1
clear	1
reception	1
and	1
transmission.	1
1	1
bad	1
fit,	1
way	1
too	1
big.	1

It	1
definitely	1
was	1
not	1

I'll	1

This	1
is	1

had	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
cheaply	1
made.	1
0	1
Att	1
is	1
not	1
clear,	1
sound	1
is	1
very	1
distorted	1

you	1

Oh	1
and	1
I	1
forgot	1
to	1
also	1
mention	1
the	1
weird	1
color	1
effect	1
it	1
has	1
on	1
your	1
phone.	1

I'm	1
using	1
it	1
with	1
an	1
iriver	1
SPINN	1

it	1
fits	1
fine.	1
1	1
Also	1
the	1
area	1

my	1

broke).-	1

not	1
too	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
magnetic	1

Overall,	1
I	1
am	1
psyched	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
phone	1
which	1
has	1
all	1
my	1
appointments	1
and	1
contacts	1
in	1
and	1
gets	1
great	1
reception.	1
1	1
every	1
thing	1
on	1
phone	1
work	1
perfectly,	1
she	1
like	1
it.	1
1	1
Another	1
note	1
about	1
this	1
phone's	1
appearance	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
really	1
looks	1
rather	1
bland,	1
especially	1
in	1
the	1
all	1
black	1
model.	1

My	1
experience	1
was	1
terrible.....	1
This	1
was	1
my	1
fourth	1
bluetooth	1
headset,	1
and	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
much	1
more	1
comfortable	1
than	1
my	1
last	1
Jabra	1
(which	1
I	1
HATED!!!	1

accessing	1

downloading	1

performing	1
any	1
of	1
the	1

can	1
barely	1
ever	1
hear	1
on	1
it	1

The	1

That	1

everything	1

1	1
Due	1
to	1
this	1
happening	1
on	1
every	1

I	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
stop	1
using	1
this	1
headset.	1

It	1
works	1
great	1
with	1
a	1

and	1
I	1
ended	1
up	1
having	1
to	1
do	1
a	1

wiping	1

the	1

is	1

however,	1
it's	1

1	1
Better	1
than	1

1	1
It	1
feels	1
poorly	1

the	1

1	1
Their	1

my	1
phone.	1
0	1
Clear	1
crisp	1
sound.	1
1	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
use	1
the	1
smallest	1
earpieces	1
provided,	1
but	1
it	1
stays	1
on	1
pretty	1
well.	1
1	1
The	1
biggest	1
complaint	1
I	1
have	1
is,	1
the	1
battery	1
drains	1
superfast.	1
0	1
The	1
design	1
might	1
be	1
ergonomic	1
in	1
theory	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
having	1
these	1
in	1
my	1
ear.	1
0	1
Do	1
NOT	1
buy	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
use	1
the	1
holster.	1

The	1
phone	1
can	1
also	1
take	1
great	1
pictures	1
and	1
even	1
video	1
clips.	1
1	1
It	1
doesn't	1
make	1
you	1
look	1
cool.	1
0	1
Because	1
both	1
ears	1
are	1
occupied,	1
background	1
is	1
not	1
distracting	1
at	1
all.	1
1	1
Comfortable	1
fit	1
-	1
you	1
need	1
your	1
headset	1
to	1
be	1
comfortable	1
for	1
at	1
least	1
an	1
hour	1
at	1
a	1
time,	1
if	1
not	1
for	1
an	1
entire	1
day.	1
1	1
Also,	1
the	1
phone	1
doesn't	1
seem	1
to	1
accept	1
anything	1
except	1
CBR	1
mp3s,	1
preferably	1
ripped	1
by	1
Windows	1
Media	1
Player.	1

You	1
can't	1
beat	1
the	1
price	1
on	1
these.	1

Comes	1

a	1
strong	1
light	1

you	1

even	1
flash	1

1	1

just	1
beware.	1

I	1
love	1
this	1
cable	1
-	1
it	1
allows	1
me	1
to	1
connect	1
any	1
mini-USB	1
device	1
to	1
my	1
PC.	1
1	1
So	1
anyone	1
near	1
you	1
will	1
hear	1
part	1
of	1
your	1
conversation.	1
0	1
This	1
is	1
cool	1
because	1
most	1
cases	1
are	1
just	1
open	1
there	1
allowing	1
the	1
screen	1
to	1
get	1
all	1
scratched	1
up.	1
1	1
I	1
bought	1
this	1
phone	1
as	1
a	1
replacement	1
for	1
my	1
StarTac	1
and	1
have	1
regretted	1
it	1
since.	1
0	1
Appears	1
to	1
actually	1
outperform	1
the	1
original	1

The	1
phone	1
crashed	1
completely	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
replaced.	1
0	1
It	1
quit	1
working	1
after	1
I'd	1
used	1
it	1
for	1
about	1
18	1
months,	1
so	1
I	1
just	1
purchased	1
another	1
one	1
because	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
headset	1
I've	1
ever	1
owned.	1
1	1
Unfortunately	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
recharge	1
my	1
iPhone	1
4s,	1
despite	1
connecting	1
it	1
from	1
multiple	1
power	1
sources	1
(iMac,	1
external	1
battery,	1

It	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
phone.	1
1	1
if	1
you	1
simply	1
want	1
a	1
small	1
flip	1
phone	1
--	1
look	1
elsewhere	1
as	1
the	1
extra	1
bells	1
&	1
whistles	1
are	1
mediocre.	1
0	1
Good	1
value,	1
works	1
fine	1
-	1
power	1
via	1
USB,	1
car,	1
or	1
wall	1

1	1
My	1
phone	1
doesn't	1
slide	1
around	1
my	1
car	1
now	1
and	1
the	1
grip	1
prevents	1
my	1
phone	1
from	1
slipping	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hand.	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
simply	1
the	1
BEST	1
bluetooth	1
headset	1
for	1
sound	1
quality!	1
1	1
Think	1
it	1
over	1
when	1
you	1
plan	1
to	1
own	1
this	1
one!This	1
sure	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
MOTO	1
phone	1
for	1
me!	1

In	1
the	1
span	1
of	1
an	1
hour,	1
I	1
had	1
two	1
people	1
exclaim	1
"Whoa	1
-	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
phone	1
on	1
TV?!?	1
1	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
used	1
corded	1
headsets	1
and	1
the	1
freedom	1
from	1
the	1

is	1
very	1
helpful.	1
1	1
This	1

has	1
passed	1
the	1
one	1

while	1
it	1
shows	1
signs	1
of	1

it	1
is	1
100%	1
functional.	1
1	1
Other	1
than	1
that,	1
the	1
leather	1
is	1
nice	1
and	1
soft;	1
the	1
fit	1
is	1
very	1
tight;	1
the	1
cut	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
face	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
shape.	1
1	1
It	1
has	1
everything	1
I	1
need	1
and	1
I	1
couldn't	1
ask	1
for	1
more.	1
1	1
After	1
receiving	1

using	1
the	1
product	1
for	1
just	1
2	1

something.	1
1	1
None	1
of	1
the	1

Treo	1

T-Mobile	1
refused	1
to	1
replace	1

buy	1
another	1
phone	1
without	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
upgrade	1
discount.	1

It	1
was	1
horrible!.	1

securly	1

It	1

This	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
tool,	1
especially	1
when	1
paired	1
with	1
your	1
phone's	1
auto-answer.	1
1	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
other's	1
reviews	1
here	1
but	1
I	1
haven't	1
had	1
any	1
problem	1
with	1
it.	1
1	1

products	1
cover	1
up	1

If	1
I	1
take	1
a	1

the	1

drops	1
a	1

and	1
starts	1
beeping,	1
letting	1
me	1
know	1
its	1

Terrible	1

waste	1

Last	1
time	1
buying	1
from	1
you.	1
0	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
waste	1
of	1
my	1
money.	1
0	1
So	1
far	1
it	1
has	1
worked	1
like	1
a	1
charm.	1
1	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
had	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
weeks,	1
but	1
so	1
far,	1
so	1
good.	1
1	1
But,	1
in	1
any	1
case,	1
the	1
best	1
part	1
is,	1
you	1
can	1
download	1
these	1
pictures	1
to	1
your	1
laptop	1
using	1
IR,	1
or	1
even	1
send	1
pictures	1
from	1
your	1
laptop	1
to	1
the	1
phone.	1
1	1
Would	1
recommend	1
this	1
item.	1
1	1
It's	1
been	1
my	1
choice	1
headset	1
for	1
years.Great	1
sound;	1
good	1
volume;	1
good	1
noise	1
cancellation.	1

Nice	1
case,	1
feels	1

item	1
received	1
was	1
Counterfeit.	1

Just	1
really	1
good..	1
So	1
far,	1
probably	1
the	1
best	1
BT	1
headset	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
had.	1
1	1
Works	1
fine.	1
1	1
I	1
received	1
my	1
headset	1
in	1
good	1
time	1
and	1
was	1
happy	1
with	1
it.	1
1	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
replace	1
my	1
well	1
travled	1
swivel	1
holster	1
for	1
my	1
Blackberry	1
flip.	1
1	1
My	1
sister	1
has	1
one	1
also	1
and	1
she	1
loves	1
it.	1
1	1
Good	1
Quality.	1
1	1
This	1
is	1
by	1

the	1
worst	1
purchase	1
I've	1

It	1
seems	1
completely	1

keeping	1
the	1

Best	1

ever!!!.	1

Don't	1

their	1
website	1

don't	1
expect	1
any	1
helpful	1
support.	1

It	1
was	1
that	1
loud.Glad	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
Plantronics	1
510	1
maintains	1
a	1
flawless	1
connection	1
to	1
my	1
cell	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
static	1
during	1
normal	1
use.	1
1	1
The	1
speaker	1
is	1
of	1
low	1

as	1
making	1
the	1
ring	1

The	1
pairing	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
devices	1
was	1
so	1
easy	1
it	1
barely	1
took	1
a	1
couple	1
minutes	1
before	1
I	1
started	1
making	1
calls	1
with	1
the	1
voice	1
dialing	1
feature.	1
1	1
This	1
was	1
utterly	1
confusing	1
at	1
first,	1
which	1
caused	1
me	1
to	1
lose	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
very,	1
very	1
important	1
contacts.	1
0	1
Terrible	1
phone	1
holder.	1
0	1
The	1
cutouts	1
and	1
buttons	1
are	1
placed	1
perfectly.	1
1	1
I	1
love	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
use	1
one	1
headset	1
for	1
both	1
by	1
land-line	1
and	1
cell.	1
1	1
Problem	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
ear	1
loops	1
are	1
made	1
of	1
weak	1
material	1
and	1
break	1
easily.	1
0	1
Not	1
nearly	1
as	1
good	1
looking	1
as	1
the	1
AMAZON	1
picture	1
makes	1
it	1
look.	1
0	1
But	1
despite	1
these	1
few	1
flaws,	1
this	1
case	1
is	1
of	1
exceptional	1
quality	1
and	1
well	1
worth	1
the	1
additional	1
costs	1
of	1
owning	1
an	1
official	1
OEM	1
product.	1
1	1
How	1
stupid	1
is	1
that?	1
0	1
I	1
can	1
hear	1
while	1
I'm	1
driving	1
in	1
the	1
car,	1
and	1
usually	1
don't	1
even	1
have	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
it's	1
loudest	1
setting.	1
1	1
Seller	1
shipped	1
quickly	1
and	1
much	1
cheaper	1
than	1
the	1
competitors.	1
1	1
Good	1
show,	1
Samsung.	1
1	1
So	1
I	1
bought	1
about	1
10	1
of	1
these	1
and	1
saved	1
alot	1
of	1
money.	1
1	1
It	1
always	1
cuts	1
out	1
and	1
makes	1
a	1
beep	1
beep	1
beep	1
sound	1
then	1
says	1

failed.	1

My	1
phone	1
sounded	1
OK	1
(	1
not	1
great	1
-	1
OK),	1
but	1
my	1
wife's	1
phone	1
was	1
almost	1
totally	1
unintelligible,	1
she	1
couldn't	1
understand	1
a	1
word	1
being	1
said	1
on	1
it.	1
0	1
So	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
battery	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
phone	1
put	1
it	1
all	1
back	1
together	1
and	1
then	1
restart	1
it.	1

While	1
I	1
managed	1
to	1
bend	1
the	1
leaf	1
spring	1
back	1
in	1
place,	1
the	1
metal	1
now	1
has	1
enough	1

the	1

it	1
is	1

but	1
it	1
is	1

i	1
would	1
really	1
recommend	1

it	1
easier	1

However,	1
after	1
about	1
a	1
year,	1
the	1
fliptop	1
started	1
to	1
get	1
loose	1
and	1
wobbly	1
and	1
eventually	1
my	1
screen	1
went	1
black	1
and	1
I	1
couldn't	1
receive	1

place	1
calls.	1

I	1
kept	1
catching	1
the	1
cable	1
on	1
the	1

I	1
had	1
to	1
pull	1
the	1
phone	1
out	1
to	1
turn	1
it	1
on	1

off.	1

The	1

Headset	1
is	1

1	1
I	1
like	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
it	1
rests	1
lightly	1
against	1
your	1
ear,	1
rather	1
than	1
inside.	1
1	1
A	1
lot	1
of	1
websites	1
have	1
been	1
rating	1
this	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
phone	1

so	1
do	1
I.	1
1	1
I	1
have	1
tried	1
these	1
cables	1
with	1
my	1
computer	1
and	1
my	1
iPod	1
and	1
it	1
works	1
just	1
fine.	1
1	1
The	1
mic	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
joke,	1

about	1

product	1
over	1
the	1
Motorola	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
allot	1
clearer	1
on	1
the	1
ear	1
piece	1
and	1
the	1
mic.	1
1	1
However,	1
the	1
keypads	1
are	1
so	1
tinny	1
that	1
I	1
sometimes	1
reach	1
the	1
wrong	1
buttons.	1

I	1
exchanged	1
the	1
sony	1
ericson	1
z500a	1
for	1
this	1
and	1
I'm	1
pretty	1
happy	1
with	1
that	1
decision.	1
1	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
impressed	1
with	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
the	1
cases.	1
1	1
Also	1
makes	1
it	1
easier	1
to	1
hold	1
on	1
to.	1

I	1
use	1
this	1
product	1
in	1
a	1

where	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
high	1
voltage	1
humming	1
from	1
the	1
equipment,	1
and	1
it	1
works	1
great!	1
1	1
It's	1
pretty	1
easy.	1

I	1
cannot	1

it's	1
very	1

SWEETEST	1
PHONE!!!	1
1	1
:-)Oh,	1
the	1
charger	1
seems	1
to	1
work	1
fine.	1
1	1
It	1
fits	1
so	1
securely	1
that	1
the	1
ear	1
hook	1
does	1
not	1
even	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
used	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
is	1
better	1
directed	1
through	1
your	1
ear	1
