# A sneak peek into airbnb

To analyze the vibe of the neighborhood from the available listing dataset and to suggest users some relevant listings based on his/her past experience or locality preference is the ideal goal of this project. We achieved this by building a reactive-big data project using Akka and Play framework.

## Technologies Used

####Play-Framework
####Akka
####Slick(to help us make async DB calls to blocking DB)
####MySQL
####Kafka
####Spark Streaming
####Spark MLlib
####HBase
####Apache Zookeeper
####HDFS
####Angular JS
####Chart JS
