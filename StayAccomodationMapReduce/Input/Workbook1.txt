Die Betreuung meiner G’_ste ist mein Beruf und somit kann ein professioneller Service erwartet werden. Ich habe sichergestellt, dass 24 Stunden t’_glich jemand f’_r die G’_ste erreichbar ist. Probleme k’_nnen somit fast immer innerhalb k’_rzester Zeit gel’_st werden. Wenn ich selbst reise, ist mir die Hotelauswahl nat’_rlich sehr wichtig. Ich teste dann kleine B&B's, Apartments oder auch mal Luxushotels, um von dem Serviceangebot Anderer zu lernen. Mein Motto f’_r mein Gesch’_ft ist daher ein Angebot zu schaffen, wie ich es selbst vorfinden m’_chte. Mein Ziel ist es immer wieder zufriedene G’_ste zu haben, die mich weiter empfehlen.
